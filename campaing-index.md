  and
  Shadow](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/278377/Disciples-of-Bone--Shadow?affiliate_id=1914894)
  Narrative Playbook** (actual plays from the playtesting). 
  * Eldara's adventures: [part
    1]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/04/13/play-report-disciples-of-bone-and-shadow-playtest-1/),
    [part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/04/16/play-report-disciples-of-bone-and-shadow-playtest-2/). RIP

* Unnamed hexcrawl campaign with **[Labyrinth
  Lord](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78524/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord-noart-version)**
  (which is in the process of being switched to [Old School
  Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials)).
  * On hiatus until I get the new Old-School Essentials Advanced Fantasy book.
  
* **[Barrowmaze](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete?affiliate_id=1914894)**
 with Old-School Essentials.
     * Probably abandoned. I didn't like exploring a pregenerated dungeon, I'll
       need to change my method or I will definitely give up on this campaign
       and reuse the characters for something else.
      
* **[Ruins of the
  Undercity](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/109821/Ruins-of-the-Undercity?affiliate_id=1914894)**
  with Old-School Essentials.
