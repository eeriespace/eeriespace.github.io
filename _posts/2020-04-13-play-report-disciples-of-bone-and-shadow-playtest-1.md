This is a play report of my playtest campaign of the upcoming **Narrative
playbook for [Disciples of Bone and
Shadow](https://blackoathgames.com/disciples-of-bone-shadow)**, you can read
more about this book in the [official
announcement](https://blackoathgames.com/news).

**Please note:** this report uses a work-in-progress book that the author is
improving, enhancing and changing everyday, thereby everything is subject to
change.

## Meet the protagonist: Eldara

I roll everything randomly but the character's class, I wanted them to be a
Vitalist since the archetype gives abilities related to healing, if you have
been reading my play reports of my [Seekers Beyond the
Shroud]({{site.baseurl}}/tag/seekers-beyond-the-shroud/) campaign, you know
that my character there is extremely awful at healing, so I thought that I
might use this chance to change my luck or die trying.

So, she is a woman, Vitalist, her advantage is that she's been an alchemy
apprentice, the disadvantage is that she has some family ties (maybe she needs
to send them money?), her home region is Madari and she is a Coward III, which
means that she *must* try to escape from every fight, since that's her
instinct. I purchase *Stealthy* as one of her passive skills and *Discipline*
as another active skill. Stealthy lets me re-roll once a failed Stealth skill
check and Discipline is for casting once a spell with no more uses left.

> So I think that she is well built for self-preservation. 

**Name:** Eldara (female)

> I've recently played to Warhammer 40k Killteam, and guess what? I use
> Eldars.  Sorry for my lack of originality.

**Age:** old granny

**Archetype:** Vitalist

**Starting equipment:** shield and sword

**Stats:** strength 11, dexterity 13, constitution 10, will 18, intelligence
18, charisma 10

**Skills:** (I'm only listing the ones where I spent points) alchemy 40,
disguise 30, first aid 50, forbidden lore 35, herb lore 35, literacy 40,
one-handed melee 50, orientation 30, parry 50, perception 29, sneaking 50.

> I need to re-check those since some skills' base points have changed.

I buy a *lantern*, *bandages* x10 and equip her with a sword and a shield. She
carries 10 provisions.

### Eldara's story

Eldara started her alchemical studies at a young age taken under the tutelage
of a master alchemist, **Kildrun**. She taught her the ways of the alchemists
and Eldara got to know more about this art secretly studying more. One day she
met the alchemy master's son, and a few months later she could no longer hide
her fat belly. She kicked her out but just after taking her newborn *"This
child will be what your arrogance and ingratitude prevented you from becoming"*

But that happened several decades ago, Eldara is now a very old woman. She
spent her life leaving some jats from time to time in her son's house, which
eventually grew up and became a father himself. She wanders through the
Whiteteeth peninsula earning her living as a healer, carrying a small knife
that she was unable to use to prevent her old master Kildrun from taking her
baby from her. She has always felt extremely guilty about not being able to
defend her son when she was younger, and the only solace that she has found in
all these years is to heal others with her magic and giving the profits that
she gains from it to her son.

## Part #1 of the adventure

I roll for a rumour to get things started, I get *"There's a patch of land
nearby that raises anything dead buried in it"*.

So I think that the first goal for Eldara will be to investigate this rumour
and try to get some substances or anything that causes that phenomenon in order
to maybe sell it and get a profit? She has a background in alchemy, so maybe
she can monetise it. For now this is the main story arc.

I use the *Undertaking a Journey* rules, since we will be hexcrawling without a
clear destination. I get that my journey will have 4 important milestones.

And we start!

### Hex 2, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surpirse``

Eldara reaches a graveyard, she feels that this place is related to the site
that she is looking for but her thoughts are interrupted by the graveyard
keeper, an old man. He has seen her and takes a shovel, then shouts at her
shovel on hand *"Get out of here you diabolic corpse raisers!"* ``Augur
results + develop, leader``

> While I was playing this scene I realised that I forgot to roll in the Madari
> hex exploration table, I used the standard one from Disciples instead, but
> since it seemed thematic I didn't redo it.

The man looks very angry and Eldara doesn't want to get hurt, so she leaves
this place and keeps on her journey. ``Roleplaying as a Coward``

``-1 ration`` ``Not in control of the situation``

### Hex 20, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surprise``

Eldara is walking now through some farmland and some farm animals, as she is
walking she finds the dead body of what looks like a noble woman. The woman has
been dead a long time, and near her body there is a bow with a single iron
arrow, maybe she was a hunter. *"This will sell for a fortune"* Eldara thinks. 

Eldara spends some time digging a grave for the woman and then she buries the
body, as she is eating a ration to rest and recover from the hard work of
digging a grave is, she realises that the noble hunter had something to do with
the place that she is searching, since the land begins to move and the noble
woman rises.

``Augur: the body has something to do with the quest``

The hunter gets in a hostile attitude and Eldara prepares to escape. ``NPC
starting attitude: hostile``
> I re-skin the hunter as a Bandit (60HP) from Disciples, the bestiary was on
> the works. She is unarmed (d10 damage) since Eldara has already taken her
> bow.

Eldara wins the initiative and tries to sneak out of the confrontation, but she
is unable, she uses another opportunity to do so, but fails again. She
overcomes her fear of fighting and faces the noble hunter woman. ``Sneak test +
Stealthy skill`` ``WILL test, hard modifier due to Coward III`` 

Combat begins and she cannot avoid the hunter's first punch. ``-1HP`` Eldara
attacks first this turn, but she is old and her bones ache, so she doesn't deal
any damage; she manages to avoid the hunter's punch. The hunter goes first and
punches Eldara in the face ``-7HP``, Eldara returns a blow from her sword which
causes a very bad looking wound to the hunter ``-34HP``. Eldara's next blow
fails. The hunter goes first again, but Eldara dodges, then she strikes her
sword and the hunter dies. ``-34HP`` ``+10XP``

Eldara has learned her lesson and doesn't try to bury the corpse again. She
tears the sleeves from the hunter's shirt and uses the cloth to tie the
corpse's hands and legs.

She doesn't see anything that could help her discover about her mission, so she
continues her journey, she uses some bandages to patch her wounds. ``+4HP``
``First Aid check``

> Eldara's very first First Aid check was a success!

``-1 ration`` ``Not in control of the situation``

### Hex 21, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surprise``

Eldara's day begins discovering a small cave. A small sign says **Obsidian
Hollow**, it must be known among the local tribes, but she doesn't think that
it has anything to do with the strange events, so she passes through.

``Augur: the cave has nothing to do with the mission`` ``Used the 
random cave name generator`` 


She keeps on her journey. ``-1 provisions``

### Hex 39, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``Surprise: encounter neutral``

Eldara comes across a woman that walks in her direction to then greet her. She
is a guide. Eldara asks about some kind of place where the living raise after
being buried but she doesn't know about it; however, she tells her that she has
seen people presumed dead come back to the living, this has happened while she
was doing her job as a guide. ``Augur: no, but...`` 

Eldara starts to think that this strange events are not happening due to
something, but someone. ``Augur: an assumption of the PC is wrong``

The guide is not wearing or carrying anything strange, but she feels an eerie
energy emanating from her clothes. ``Augur: no, but...`` ``Augur: energy``

Eldara asks to the guide whether she has been around people lately, she
nods. She has been the guide to an individual, but she hasn't been a guide of
the nearby cave. ``Augur: yes, but``

Eldara asks whether she can give her the direction where she left this
individual, and she shows it to her. ``Augur: yes`` 

``Augur: guide, burden, needs a favour or has a job``
``Action, theme: open, death, misfortune``

> I haven't used all the descriptors.

Eldara thanks the guide and continues to the way that the guide has shown her.

``-1 ration`` ``In control of the situation``


### Hex 38, Madari region


``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surprise``

Eldara meets a travelling group of healers, a man and a woman, which identify
her as a fellow healer and are friendly, they offer her some
rations. ``Encounter: human, travelling group, healers, friendly`` ``+1
ration``

Eldara asks them if they know anything about people with abnormal energy
inside their bodies, but they cannot say so, they think that they wouldn't be
capable of feeling something of the likes. ``Augur``

Eldara asks then if they know anything about people coming back from the dead,
and they tell her that they have indeed heard rumours about that and that they
have seen something, but it wasn't in a nearby place. ``Augur`` 

The direction of where that thing happened coincides with the direction that
the guide gave her yesterday. ``Augur``

She thanks the couple and goes on.

``-1 ration`` ``In control of the situation``

### Hex 54, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surprise``

She comes across a soldier, he isn't from the **Dusk Blades**, Eldara thinks
that maybe he is from another region, since she doesn't recognise the patterns
from his clothes. The soldier is nice and tells her that he comes from
investigating a cult that is oppressing a group of people. Eldara asks herself
if that could have any relation to what she is looking for: people raising from
the death or people with strange energy; and asks the soldier about those. He
nods, definitely that cult seems capable of having those powers. She asks for
the location of the cult's base, and he tells her the direction.

``Encounter: human, lone individual, soldier, friendly, offers assistance`` 
``Goal: oppress, a cult, advice``

``-1 ration`` ``In control of the situation``
