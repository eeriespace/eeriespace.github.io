**· HEX J18, Akkar Strand.** Thythe finds the remains of a caravan covered by
volcanic ash. Whatever was it what happened here, no one was left alive. Thythe
doesn't know what to think about this scene, volcanic ash suggests nearby lava
or a fire, but the carts aren't burned, moreover there are small black spiders
everywhere. Better to get out here quickly.

> Thythe eats a ration per day, but sometimes I just update it on my character
> sheet instead of writing anything about it.

``Twist: 2 -> 2`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX K19, A.S.** She continues heading east, and some **Centipede** comes
into her sight. She deals with it very quickly.

``Twist: 2 -> 2`` ``+2XP hex`` ``+5XP vermin``

**· HEX L18, A.S.**  She comes across a very large tree, it certainly stands
out surrounded by black sand and some low hills. She tries to find some herbs,
this may be a good place to find something exiting, but nothing is to be found.

``Twist: 2 -> 2`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX M19, A.S.** A weird sensation accompanies her through this day, she
doesn't know what it is but this land gives her peace of mind and she feels
rested.

> It is a hallowed land, it is useful to avoid corruption.

``Twist: 2 -> 2`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX N18, A.S.**  Today she discovers some mysterious ruins on her way
east. She doesn't have time to explore them now, but she takes a mental note of
their location. The bad news is that the terrain is difficult to go through, so
she is going to be delayed.

> Difficult terrain takes double time to travel.

The second day travelling through these ruins she encounter a group of **Giant
Mosquitoes**, they don't seem very dangerous, so Thythe fights them, and she
prevails, but she has taken a light hit. She spends some time trying to patch
the new wound with a bandage, but she doesn't achieve anything
fruitful. ``First aid fail``

``Twist: 2 -> 1`` ``+5XP vermin`` ``+2XP hex``

She decides to spend a day resting at the edge of the ruins. ``+5HP``

``Twist: 1 -> 1``

**· HEX O19, A.S.** Thythe arrives at her destination, she hopes to find the
hunter here. This is a rocky region with many small caves excavated in some
small hills. She doesn't see any clear signs of anybody living in the caves at
first sight.

``Is the hunter hidden? Likeyly`` Thythe thinks that it makes sense for
them to be hidden. ``Perception check OK`` She finds some marks in one of the
caves that  could only have been left by a human, so she decides to explore
that cave. She lights her lamp.

- 0: Entrance. The walls of this caved are covered with small drops of water,
  there is a lot of humidity in the air.

- 1: Corridor. Thythe takes the first to the right, but it is a dead
  end. 
  
- 2: Room. She backtracks and goes straight, she is now in a big circled
  room. She hears the sound of water, this cave seems to be connected to an
  underground spring. Quite convenient, she thinks. ``Rations + 4`` 
  
  ``Is the hunter here? very likely`` ``Perfection check OK``
  Thythe finds a young person, they are  cleaning some clothes in the
  stream. Thythe is quite surprised. Younger people aren't usually capable of
  threatening other people and actually doing what they did to the folks of
  the Clear Wood settlement. ``Does they notice Thythe? Very likely, but...``
  ``A new character is revealed`` ``Reinforcements`` ``Is it a person?
  impossible, but an item is found or lost`` ``Action: inform, theme:
  community``  The child does notice Thythe, and they are hostile, they yell at
  her that they are part of a bigger community and that their absence will be
  noticed. ``Do they attack? Impossible, and...`` ``Change to the physical
  environment`` ``Action: finish, theme: mystery`` The child doesn't become
  more hostile and just continues cleaning the piece of cloth, as they did
  before Thythe came. Suddenly, the water in the spring dries out, and then,
  also as suddenly, it continues to flow normally.
  ``Is the child causing this effect? Almost impossible`` ``Is there something
  in the clothes? Unlikely`` Thythe asks them if they know of any hunter
  related to the Clear Wood settlement. ``Do they know anyone? Impossible`` The
  child  ignores her.
  
  ``Are other people of their community nearby? Almost certain, but...`` ``A
  new character is revealed`` ``Action: restore, Theme: possessions``
  ``Friendly, servant, offers direct assistance, woman, young`` Thythe is
  surprised again when a new face enters this room, she is also young, a bit
  older than the child, and threats the child with respect. She talks to
  Thythe, *'How can I be of assistance?'*
  
  Thythe is a bit worried about the new woman. She has walked in without making
  any sound, and looks dangerous. *'I'm investigating a flood that has
  destroyed a settlement nearby, to the west. They seem to blame a hunter from
  your area,'* Thythe says. ``Do they know him? Almost certain, and..``
  ``Unexpected event, action-theme: gratify-opposition`` The woman tells her
  that she knows who she might be referring to, but suddenly the water in the
  spring starts emerging violently. The woman and the kid look at each other,
  she takes the child's hand and points at the exit with her other hand. *'We
  have to get out of here right now, this place will get flooded in no time,'*
  the woman points out. Thythe follows her and the child to he exit of the
  cave.
  
*'Do you know what has happened?'* Thythe asks. ``Does she know? Equal chances,
and...`` ``Useful item is found`` The woman ignores her and picks and object
from the ground, it looks like a glass jar with a pink liquid inside.

> Random triket generator from our lovely internet.

*'I don't really know for sure, but this hunter that you're looking for is not
just a common hunter, we have been running away from him for many years,'* the
woman says. *'He just doesn't give up,'* the woman opens the glass jar and the
pink liquid evaporates, then she takes out something that may or may not be
human flesh, *'and he has been using strange artefacts to track us,'* she 
continues. Thythe doesn't want to know why is this hunter after them once she
has seen what the jar had inside.

``Do they know where he is? Almost certain`` - Thythe asks, and the woman
nods. ``Can they help her locate him? very likely`` - Thythe asks, and the
woman agrees to help her. Thythe wonders if she should tell her about her true
goal. She needs to get rid of this hunter, but she doesn't know how the woman
will react. She decides to tell her and take a risk. *'My goal is to
assassinate this hunter,*' Thythe says. *'Will that be a problem for you?'*
Thythe asks. ``Almost imposible`` The woman shakes her head, *'We will be
grateful,'* she says as she embraces the child. *'We need to act quickly
then'*, Thythe asks her if she knows when the hunter will find them this time
``In a couple of days? unlikely`` ``In a couple of hours? unlikely`` ``In some
minutes? likely`` *'Will you fight him with me to protect the child?'* Thythe
asks ``Almost certain`` The woman nods, *'But the well being of the child comes
first.'*

> So, I roll a random archetype for her from the sellswords chapter. She is
> going to be a burglar.

Thythe readies her bow while the woman takes out a hidden dagger, the child
hides between some rocks nearby.

An arrow comes flying towards Thythe as she sees the hunter in the
distance. The woman starts running towards him, she needs to be close to be
useful. Thythe shots an arrow and misses, then she takes her sword and follows
the woman. In close range the hunter has still advantage, he manages to land a
few hits to the woman and to Thythe, but after the battle prolongs, he is
overwhelmed, it's two against one. After a few minutes the hunter is killed by
the woman, a lump of blood comes out of his mouth, incapable of speaking his
last words. ``+25XP``

Thythe and the woman search the hunter's belongings and split the
valuables.

> Of course, I get the best stuff: Healing tincture, 2 torches, 5 rations,
> light armor. The woman gets a short bow, a dagger and 5 rations.

``+2XP hex`` ``Twist: 1 -> 2``
