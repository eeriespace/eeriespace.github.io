 parts of the campaign.
 
## Monday, first quarter - Day 15 at the Omphalos

Ezra is back again in town, Lana ignores him. ``Event: Ezra, the mind mender`` 

> Poor Ezra.

As Lana walks to the Hall of the Orders, she comes across **Anish Larson**, a
famous mage. She speaks with him about the difficulties that she is facing with
the *Consecration rituals* and he is not impressed. ``Event: celebrity``
``CHA test``

At the Hall of the Orders, representatives from the Kadmonites and Mesu-Betesh
are in their posts. Lana avoids the Kadmonites, she doesn't want to attract
more attention until more time has passed since [Mary's
death]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/27/play-report-more-than-a-week-of-magic-ritual-training/).

The man managing the Mesu-Betesh missions in the same one that gave her the
[egyptian amulet recovery
mission]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/27/play-report-the-egyptian-amulet/) some
time ago (the one with smokey eyes), her second mission for the Omphalos. Since
it went well, the adept remembers her, and introduces himself. He is **Ghiyath
Saleem**, a middle ranked adept in the Mesu-Betesh order, he is one of the
regulars handling the missions. He wants her to join the defensive force to
defend one of his Order's sanctums, that is under siege by a rival sect.
> Nope. This is a 100% combat oriented mission and Lana is weak.

Lana politely turns down the mission. 

She really needs some money, she doesn't want to burn her just-in-case last
obols paying the fee for the ritual chamber, so she heads back home.

> Lana's financial cushion is about 1000ø, she could rent the ritual chamber
> but the cushion contemplates having to buy another *Kevlar armour*, so let's
> preserve it that way.

## Tuesday, first quarter - Day 16 at the Omphalos

Today is a hectic day and many things are happening at the same time, Ezra is
back again and there is some order dispute, so no representatives are going to
be present today. ``Event: hectic day + ezra + order dispute``

> This Ezra is surely in need of some obols, he is working too much.

There are many people walking around this day, however may of them are heading
to the private meeting that the Orders are having, so Lana is able to speak
with **Rosa A. Cunningham**, a Salvadorean adept that is an expert of the
astral. Lana doesn't know much about the astral, but Rosa explains all about it
to Lana and her enthusiasm is well received. She gives her her phone
number. ``CHA test`` ``+50 favour with Causa Scientiae``

> We are at 575 with Causa Scientieae now! Only 25 to go to get to Rank I and
> obtaining the title of *She Who Hates Chimeras* (among other actual useful
> things).

Lana heads home.

## Wednesday, full moon - Day 17 at the Omphalos

When Lana arrives at the Omphalos, some people follow her with their glares,
she picks up some chatting, apparently refusing the mission from the Mesu-Betesh
was not well taken, and now all the Orders resent her. ``Event: disappointed
mentors`` ``Gain half favour on the next mission``

She sees a suspicious figure again and follows them, this time there is a sect
planning some assassination, Lana is not in good terms with the Orders right
now, but she decides to report this. ``Encounter: suspicious figure`` ``+50
favour with all orders`` 

> Technically the previous event causes -50% favour with *the next mission*. So
> she can gain the full favour points for this encounter.

The higher ups report back saying that the **Cult of the Dying Sun** were the
ones planing the murder, and that she should watch her back.

> Another antagonist. But guess what?

Cecil comes to congratulate her, she is now  **Rank I with the Causa
Scientiae Order**!! She gives her a plastic miniature, hand painted, as a
present, is a chimera with the following engraved text on the base: I LIKE
CHEWING YOU.

Lana keeps joking with Cecil and tells her that they should refer to her from
now own as: Lana Vanne, *Who Hates Chimeras*.

Lana's DEX improves.

> Although I really wanted her to know the formula of the *Salamander's Gift*
> (heals HP to max), the alchemy requirement to cook it is very high (50), so

She heads to the Hall of Orders, the news of her being Rank I have already
spread and surprisingly, The Siddha Order, which Lana has never contacted
before, is at the Omphalos. There are also representatives from the Causa
Scientiae, but Lana heads to the representative of the Siddha Order regardless.

A corpulent woman with a scar on her face, wearing makeup to conceal it,
and an untidy hairstyle welcomes her, she is **Paek Ja-Ok**, Korean, but she
has recently moved to London since her Order needs someone to take this
mission.

> I use **Knave** to roll her appearance and then a random nationality
> generator.
>
> Paek is her family name and Ja-Ok her name.

Paek is a bit uncomfortable telling her the situation, an ex-member of the
Order has stolen the Gem of Resurrection, a mythical relic property of the
Siddha for centuries that aids them trying to recover lost souls through
meditation. Lana knew that this hard to meet Order had rather surprising
occultists among their ranks, but this is very intriguing. Paek wants her to
recover the Gem of Resurrection finding the thief, which the Order had located
through facial recognition in the Natural History Museum. The goal is to
recover the Gem and bring the thief to them, but if opposition arises, the
Order prioritises recovering the Gem. ``Mission: get the thief`` 
``Search 16``

> I use a random magic effect generator and magic item generator to know which
> shape has the item to recover and which effect does it have.

Lana accepts the mission.

## At the National History Museum

### Entry Hall

As Lana enters though the big crystal doors of the museum, a **Daeva** greets
her. Combat begins. Lana acts first and shots her pistol to the Daeva, but
fails, then quickly draws her knife to attack the creature, but fails yet
again, the Daeva attacks but Lana avoids the blow. Lana goes first again and
deals some damage to the Daeva, the creature casts *Vril choke*, and Lana falls
paralysed. The creature casts *Vril choke* again. Then it attacks, but Lana
avoids the attack. Now she can move, but the Daeva is quicker, attacks her, but
Lana parries and then she is unable to connect her next attack. The creature
acts first, and casts again *Vril choke*, then again, its VP are now
depleted. The creature attacks and Lana parries. She cannot be quicker so the
creature attacks, but she critically parries the attack and then uses her knife
to hit it twice in a turn, the creature dies.

> *Vril choke* deals d20 damage and makes the target lose its next turn.

As Lana walks through the entry hall, shadows, sad feelings and doubts assault
her, she is unable to get rid of these feelings. She looses -5 points in a
skill. ``WILL check``
> I choose to lose 5 points of STR, then readjust the associated skills.

> that could be catastrophic.

> Blackoath discord for spotting my mistake.

Lana tries to patch her wounds but fails.

### Lobby

She heads to the lobby, there is another enemy, a sect adept that has become
the **Vessel** of a spirit, the adept, a woman, is hostile. ``NPC reaction:
hostile``

Lana is critically slower to get ready for the fight, but she manages to parry
the first attack. She tries to retreat but fails. She is quicker this time and
tries to retreat once again, but fails, she parries the incoming attack. The
vessel is quicker this round, but Lana can also parry this attack, then
retreats and suffers and attack as she flees.

She tries to use a bandage but it falls to the ground.

She has now stepped into a *Vril dead zone*, the air is stale and she feels
like walking in a thin fog. ``-20 VP``

> When I rolled this event I misread 'Zombie dead zone' and hoped to avoid
> getting another enemy, but it was just me not reading things well.

She cannot patch her wounds.

### Administrative Office 1

There is a **Guard** making her rounds around the museum, she is not
friendly. ``NPC reaction: hostile``

Lana is quicker than her and sneaks out of her sight. ``Sneaking check``

Her off-hand arm starts to itch, and a white pus has started to pour off her
injuries, they are clearly infected. ``Heal -50%``

> Haha, they're being optimistic and suppose that I can actually pass a *First
> aid* check.
> 
> But really, whyyyyyyyyy?

She finds some herbs in the table of an employee, they are labelled as
*"Medicinal herbs"*, she hasn't a vast knowledge of medicinal herbs, but she
chews them and then applies the mixture to one of her cuts. She doesn't feel
any change, but now at least the infected wound smells like flowers and less
like iron.

> This is another great example of why homeopathy doesn't work folks, she needs
> some bandages and antibiotics.
>
> Very thematic event by the way.

She cannot apply bandages to her infected wound, she cannot keep her hands
still.

### Hallway 1

There aren't any enemies on sight, she rests for a bit and manages to apply
a sticking plaster to her wound.

### Exhibition hall 2 

She finally reaches to the first exhibition hall of the museum, there is some
kind of barrier, she notices it, but she cannot do anything about it. ``WILL
test at -5`` ``-5 sanity, -5HP``

> Now I need this Ezra mind healer!

She applies more plasters to her wounds.

### Exhibition hall 1

This exhibition is a bit strange, there are pills, syringes and bongs... she
realises that maybe this is not part of the exhibit and that maybe someone has
thrown a party or something. ``All enemies: -10 defence, +20HP``

> 'cause they're high

She uses more plasters, these things are easier to handle than the bandages.

Lana starts looking for the thief now, but she doesn't find anything suspicious.

### Exhibition hall 2

She goes back to this hall, nothing happens.

### Exhibition hall 3

A **Hunter** walks by and completely ignores Lana, walks towards exhibit hall
1, his gaze lost. ``NPC reaction: indifferent``

Lana bumps into one of the display cases, and a security cam quickly turns, she
has gotten their attention. ``All enemies: awareness + 10``

She looks around, this hall is big, but she doesn't find the thief.

She is unable to apply another plaster to her wounds.

### Hallway 1

Nothing happens.

### Hallway 2

A female **Ichorite** (a black magic user that has powers resembling to
vampires) walks by and smiles to Lana. *"Evening darling, I usually come here
to uhmm 'party', I thought that you might want to join me, but you don't look
so well, does that wound smell of jasmine? Poor thing, take this book, you
might actually learn how to make a proper healing ointment. Let's play another
day."* ``NPC reaction: friendly``

Lana thanks the woman and takes the *Alchemical treatise* that she has gifted
her.

> YES! I was afraid that she would bite her or something, we already have
> enough on our plate with the chimeras.

Lana searches for the thief and she locates them heading for the next exhibit
hall. She stops the figure, **she is a woman with elegant looks and dressed to
kill**.
``NPC flavour: hesitant, elegant, romance, internal security director``

She tries to persuade the woman, she looks hesitant, Lana is covered in wounds,
but that actually impresses her, she thinks that Lana might actually be strong
and dangerous, seeing that she is still standing with those wounds. ``CHA
test``

> She is at 64 health!! She's been worse.

Lana sees how she's looking at her and tries to persuade her, it would be more
comfortable if she would surrender to her employer. The woman
accepts. ``NPC reaction: unfriendly`` ``Persuasion check``

She tries to apply more plasters to her wounds under the confused look of the
thief, but she is unable.

### Hallway 1

A **Daeva** cuts the women's path. Lana engages in combat. She is way slower
that the enemy, which casts *Vril choke*, then it comes closer to hit Lana, but
she parries the attack. Lana acts first this time, she is unable to
escape. Another *Vril choke* and an attack, which is parried. Lana attacks
first, no more room to escape now, she scores a critical hit, the Daeva starts
bleeding and seems to start falling to the ground, but manages to attack, Lana
critically parries the attack. The Daeva bleeds, Lana's hit doesn't land. She
attacks again and deals max damage again, the creature is paralysed again. It
bleeds and Lana kills the creature in this last knife swing.

### Administrative Office 1

Nothing happens.

### Lobby & entrance

The thief and Lana enter the Vril dead zone and lose 20VP, then safely exit the
museum.

## At the Omphalos

Lana delivers the thief to Paek, the woman thanks her. *"Good job, hoobae. The
Siddha are thankful.* 

> *Hoobae* is how Korean people refer to workmates with less experience. To
> Lana, Paek is her *sumbae*, since she is her senior and has more experience.

She needs to mediate to try to alleviate the injuries that her mind has
sustained. She feels better. ``Meditation check`` ``Recover 3 sanity``

> If I got the rules right I can only meditate once a week, and Lana will
> recover 10 sanity naturally in a week if she doesn't suffer any more sanity
> lost.

## Mission recap

* Got an Alchemical treatise
* 500ø
* +15 order points since Lana didn't kill the thief
* 75 favour with The Siddha (half favour)
* I rule that she is able to take the Glock 17 and the baton from the thief,
  since she has apprehended her, so she can sell those for: 100ø + 400ø (half
  price) ``Appraisal check``
