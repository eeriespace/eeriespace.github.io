parts of the campaign.
 
## Tuesday, new moon - Day 30 at the Omphalos

Lana happily walks into the Omphalos, she ventured into the astral yesterday
and was able to fulfil her mission, she is slowly ascending into true occult
knowledge. 

She feels that the energy flows more abundantly through the Omphalos, and there
are many people trying to perform rituals taking the most of these extra VP
that everybody is enjoying today. She also sees a familiar faces asking for a
consecrated *athame*, *'For God's sake, why does he need to many?'* Lana
shrugs. ``Event: tapping a ley line`` ``Encounter: a man in need``

Lana rents a ritual chamber, like everybody else this day and tries another
tool consecration ritual, lights the candles, takes a *frankincense*,
aaaaand... fails. ``Magic liturgy check fail``

## Wednesday, first quarter - Day 31 at the Omphalos

Prices are higher than usual today, *'It makes sense'* Lana thinks
*'Yesterday everybody was performing rituals so maybe they are low on stock
now*'. As Lana heads to the ritual camber, she sees her *acquaintance* again,
he is back asking for consecrated *athames*. Lana thinks that she will try to
speak with him one of these days, he will surely have an interesting story to
tell. ``Event: higher prices`` ``Encounter: a man in need``

She enters the ritual chamber to try a tool consecration ritual
aaaand... fails. ``Magic liturgy check fail``

## Thursday, first quarter - Day 32 at the Omphalos

**Ghiyath Saleem**, a representative from the Mesu-betesh order comes to greet
her, apparently she has a secret admirer and they have left her a small
envelope, there is money and a note inside *'Keep up the good work! Use this to
take a coffee.'* ``+50ø`` Lana thanks Saleem for bringing the envelope. He
tells her that he has also came for another reason. He looks around before
starting to explain. ``Event: anonymous benefactor`` 

He has found and ancient grimoire that he thinks that it is related to
the **Taavi** that she is trying to invoke. He would like to decipher it
discretely, apparently he has been working with another order to which he is
not affiliated and this is a job from them, thereby he cannot ask for help to
his own order and wants Lana's knowledge. Lana agrees to help and Saleem gives
her the grimoire, she tries to make sense of what she is reading, but is far
too complex for her current level. ``Occult knowledge fail`` ``-50 favour with
random order: Mesu-betesh`` ``Encounter: problem solving``

Lana goes to practice her ritual skills consecrating a chalice
aaaaaand.... fails. ``Magic liturgy check fail`` ``Skill roll-up OK``

> Yes, we have it at 14 now!

## Friday, first quarter - Day 33 at the Omphalos

Lana wonders what has happened when she sees all the stores, bars... everything
in the Omphalos closed down. She will need to ask someone about it. ``Event:
stores closed``

Then she comes across **Cecil**, her friend from the Causa Scientiae order, she
is dressed in ritual robes and asks her to join her for a ceremony, Lana
accepts, she might learn something. She actually does learn something. ``INT
test OK`` ``Magica liturgy +1 ``   ``Encounter: ceremony``

> It is now at 15, hooray!
>
> I rolled which orders were present to know who would invite Lana.

She heads to another ritual chamber on her own to put the new knowledge that
she has acquired into action she tries a consecration ritual
aaaaaand.... fails. ``Magic liturgy check fail`` 

> Damn, I rolled a 15.


## Saturday, full moon - Day 34 at the Omphalos

A concealed person comes near Lana, she cannot make their face, they are
wearing baggy clothes with a hoodie, they come closer, Lana braces for combat,
but they give her another envelope. They disappear. There is just a smiley face
written and more pocket money ``+50ø`` ``Event: anonymous benefactor``

Lana heads to the ritual chamber, her acquaintance is still going on asking
random stranger for a consecrated *athame*, at this point Lana is past
curiosity and she is beginning to think that maybe this could be some kind of
intricate scam. ``Encounter: a man in need``

Finally she arrives at the ritual chamber, pays the fee and prepares herself
for another ritual aaaaand..... success! Lana is able to consecrate a
*chalice*! ``Magic liturgy check OK`` 

> Hooooray! Only 3 to go!

Lana is very pleased with herself.

## Sunday, full moon - Day 35 at the Omphalos

Lana sees some people in robes with the **Cult of the Dying Sun** symbol,
they're some of her enemies. She mentally thanks them for displaying their
affiliation so broadly and goes back home, she will avoid confrontation at all
costs. ``Event: bad blood``

## Monday, third quarter - Day 36 at the Omphalos

As Lana enters the Omphalos she is welcomed by a shocking scene. **Cecil**, her
friend from the Causa Scientiae order, is holding **Keith** in her arms,
another member from the order; she is trembling and sobbing, Keith is badly
injured, something seems to have gone very wrong in their last mission, he
needs a doctor, *'There is no time!*' Cecil cries, *'I... I couldn't protect
him... they were all over us and I couldn't...'* Lana holds Cecil's hand, *'I
will do my best'*.

> Poor Keith, you're screwed relying on my First Aid rolls, but you're not
> Cecil, so I am fine either way.

> I rolled beforehand which orders were present and only the Causa Scientiae
> (heart attack) was there, I only had two named Causa Scientiae members Cecil
> (heart attack) and Keith, so I randomly chose who was injured (heart
> attack). It is no secret that Lana likes Cecil better than Keith, so I was
> worried. Very worried (heart attack).

LANA PATCHES KEITH'S WOUNDS GIVING HIM A CHANCE OF LIVING BEFORE THE MEDIC
ARRIVES!! ``First aid check OK`` Cecil cries more profusely and hugs Lana *'I
was ready for the worst'*, then continues crying like a baby *'... me too'*
Lana says bewildered.

Keith reaches his backpack, still bleeding, but stable, he gives Lana an
*Alchemical treatise*, he doesn't say anything, just nods, and Lana does the
same, she is still taken aback by this heroic feat that she has just
accomplished. ``Event: wounded``

> This event is so funny. It is one of my favourites, it causes so much drama.

After the things have calmed down a little bit Cecil gives Lana an artefact, it
is something that they've recovered in this ominous mission. It is a small
pyramid shaped rock-thing, it looks sturdy but it is very light. Lana wonders
that could it be, she doesn't know exactly what it is but she recalls having
read something about this type of artefacts so she gives those pointers to
Cecil. ``Occult knowledge check OK`` ``+50 favour with Causa Scientiae`` 
``Encounter: problem solving``

Lana heads to the ritual chamber again, she has had enough drama for the day,
she needs to do something mechanical to calm herself. She lights the candles,
recites the words aaaaaaand... her *Tool consecration* ritual fails. ``Magic
liturgy check fail``


## Tuesday, third quarter - Day 37 at the Omphalos

Lana has woken up late today and is rushing to the Omphalos, she has also taken
all the shortcuts that she knows of, she needs to go through that piss
smelling narrow alley that she always avoids, but she is running late today. As
she goes through a man blocks her path, he looks gloomy and dangerous, he
could be an **Ichorite**; she can confirm that he is dangerous as he points his
ritual dagger towards her.

> I'm using a work-in-progress of the *Making combat faster* rules (see the
> Blackoath Discord).

Combat is indeed faster and the man drops down dead to the pissy alley. Lana
takes his *ritual dagger*, he has also a handwritten letter, it looks like
poetry, she thinks that she shouldn't read it, so she leaves it where it
was. ``Event: attack``

Lana finally arrives at the Omphalos and someone recognises the the *ritual
dagger* that she is carrying. They start whispering and finally a man comes
closer, *'What have you done with the owner of that dagger?'* he
demands. *'Well, he has kicked the bucket, he tried to attack me in a pissy
alley'* Lana says. The man's face turns red with anger and he punches Lana in
the face. She doesn't see it coming. Everything becomes blurry but she wakes up
shortly, a pitched battle is going on, she is not sure which are the sides
anymore. Her nose is bleeding. ``-20HP`` ``Encounter: fight``

> Yep, I rolled a 20 on a d20. Such a violent day.

She stands up and quickly goes to sell that damn dagger, it has caused her so
much problems so far. ``+100ø`` ``Appraisal check fail``

She then goes to seek shelter in a ritual chamber, she rents it for the
remaining of the day and continues her ritual training routine. She tries a
*tool consecration* ritual aaaaaand.... fails. ``Magic liturgy check fail``

## Wednesday, new moon - Day 38 at the Omphalos

Lana arrives early at the Omphalos, she doesn't want any surprises today. There
are a lot of people moving to and fro, it looks like today is a busy day.

A representative from the Siddha that she cannot recognise warns her about some
whispers that they have heard around, she needs to be cautious ``Defensive
skills +10``

Ezra, the Mind Mender is back, she hasn't seen him in a long time, she needs to
recover some sanity, but is not too bad, she doesn't need asistance. 
``Event: hectic day (inside info + Ezra)``

As she is walking to the Hall of the Orders she crosses paths with **Keith**,
who is almost completely recovered from his latest near-death
experience. Although Lana has never imagined that he would be kissing her ass
or treating her nicer since they both agree on that they don't like each
other's presence, he is actually smiling at her. Lana is confused. *'Wanna join
me in a ritual rehearsal?'* he asks. Lana agrees, but she is a bit wary of his
behaviour. Either way, she learns something. ``INT test OK``  ``Magical liturgy
+1`` ``Encounter: ceremony``

> Great!

Lana heads afterwards to the Hall of the Orders. She still has enough obols to
continue with her ritual training rutine, but she doesn't want to lose the
advantage that she has been given by that info that the spy of the Siddha has
delivered. ``Orders: C. Scientiae, Mesu-betesh, Siddha``

She goes to the stand of the Siddha, and **Paek Ja-Ok** greets her. She starts
talking shop right away, she needs her to recover an artefact, the **Jar of
Devotion**. The jar hasn't any occult properties, but it is valuable to the
Siddha since it is related to its history, and of course, since Lana isn't a
regular member of the order, she cannot know anything more specific about
it. The relic has been taken to some cult's covert base, a museum so called
**The Institute of Solar History**. The name is so weird that Paek herself
doesn't even know if the museum is about the solar system, renewable energies
or something else entirely. *'Get in, grab the jar, get out. Simple.'* she
says, *'and please avoid making unnecessary victims'*.
``Mission: recover`` ``Search 16``

> Random name generators for everything!
>
> In this mission all the enemies are going to be **Guards** and I get more
> order alignment points if I avoid killing guards.

## Generating the location: The Institute of Solar History

> Yep, I only roll museums or abandoned complexes.

## At the Institute of Solar History

### Entry hall

Lana arrives at this strange building, there is a **Guard** right at the
entrance. *'Hey, you're one of those magic-know-it-alls, aren't you? Please
have a nice visit'* she says, *'I almost forgot, take this!'* she handles a
*Grimoire* to Lana. ``NPC: friendly``

### Hallway 1

There is another **Guard** patrolling this hallway, she attacks Lana on sight
*'Hey you, this area is off limits!'* ``NPC: hostile``

Lana has been seen and cannot sneak out of this battle, but she escapes from
combat as soon as she can. ``-17HP`` 

She tries to patch up her wounds afterwards. ``First aid check OK!``
``+12HP``

> \*confetti\*

### Hallway 2

There is nothing in this hallway.

### Administrative office 1

There is another **Guard** in this office, she is comfortably sitting on a
chair playing with her phone, she suddenly stands up, embarrassed. *'I have
seen nothing'* Lana says holding up her palms. The guard shouldn't be doing
that, she's on the clock. *'Yes. Yes, you haven't seen anything'* the guard
says, *'you have just found this strange thing and you're now out on your
way.'*. Lana takes what she is giving her and happily complies. ``NPC:
friendly`` ``Magic relic: Vadasomething temple wax``

> This relic has 10 uses and allows us to replace any ingredient for alchemy,
> rituals or spells. Not bad, if I need an advanced ingredient that I cannot
> craft until my Alchemy skill gets more points I can use this instead. 

As Lana is going out of the way she sees a small sack in a shelf, she takes it
with her, it holds some doses of alchemical ingredients, there is also a small
crystal bottle with a clear liquid. ``+3 doses of alchemical ingredients``
``+1 Distillation of water`` ``Discovery: alchemical supplies``

### Hallway 2

This hallway is empty.

### Administrative office 2

This office is also empty.

### Hallway 2

Nothing da nothing.

### Hallway 1

More nothing.

### Lobby

Lana retraces her steps and enters the lobby, there is another **Guard** walking
in circles, he ignores her. ``NPC: indifferent``

As she is walking towards the next hallway she hears some voices closing by,
she hides behind two columns until the voices fade away. ``Sneaking check OK``
``Event: there are too many!``

Lana finds a small wooden box near the columns, there is a purple gem with
engraved symbols inside, she has read once about these types of gems, they're
*Gems of lucidity*, she will be able to prevent losing sanity for a while. She
takes it with her.``Occult check OK`` ``Discovery: gem of lucidity``

### Hallway 3

She exits the lobby and heads to the exhibition area, she is actually a bit
curious about discovering what type of fake museum is this. As she is lost in
her own thoughts another **Guard** appears, she draws her pistol. ``NPC:
hostile``

Lana is quicker and is able to escape, but a bullet hits her while she
escapes. ``-7HP`` 

### Exhibit hall 1

There are solar panels in this room and a couple of info graphics on how is
light converted to energy.

### Hallway 3

This hallway is empty.

### Hallway 4

Nothing here either.

### Exhibit hall 2

There is a **Guard** in this exhibit hall, he asks her what is she doing at
this hour, *'Emmm, I was just wondering what type of museum was this and I just
came to visit.'* Lana says not very confidently. The guard draws his
baton. Lana parries one of his attacks and then runs away. ``-17HP`` ``NPC:
unfriendly`` ``Persuasion check fail``

Some boxes stashed on a corner pick Lana's interest; there are strange random
items inside, she might be able to sell some of these for 50ø when she gets
back to the Omphalos. ``Perception check fail`` ``Discovery``

She takes some time to patch her wounds. ``First aid check OK`` ``+28HP``

> I'm not complaining!

### Exhibit hall 3

As Lana enters this new exhibit hall she feels pressure on all her body, she
manages to hold her sudden urge to throw up, but the the unpleasant sensation
goes on. ``WILL test fail`` ``-5 sanity nullified by the Gem of Lucidity``
``-5HP``

There is a huge mural depicting the uses of the solar energy through history;
Lana understands what most of the images want to depict, *'This is an
interesting museum'* Lana thinks. ``INT test OK`` ``+2 Astral Knowledge``

> haha very thematic. These are my very first 2 points on this skill.

She is happy to have taken some time to contemplate the mural because she
discovers a hidden button camouflaged in one of the images, she pushes it and a
sliding doors opens next to the mural. The **Jar of Devotion** is there. She
takes it with her. ``Search OK``

### Exhibit hall 2,  Hallway 4, Hallway 3, Lobby, Hallway 1

Nothing on her way back in these rooms.

### Entry hall

The **Guard** that was friendly with her a while ago when she entered the
museum has lost her patience and attacks her. She doesn't want to fight her,
and tries to escape, but she takes a hit before being able to. ``-11HP``
``-10HP``

## Back at the Omphalos

She goes to the Siddha and gives the artefact to Paek, *'It was a solar energy
museum'* Lana tells her, *'Oh well! I hope that you found it interesting. Good
job.'*

## Mission recap

* +20 order points for not killing guards 
> Super cool, the spirit that I want to summon is Order so this is beneficial.
* +500ø
* 150 favour with the Siddha

I roll the contents of the alchemical ingredients that I got before: *Spirit of
Hartshorn*, *Thion Hudor* and *Pearlash*.

We also got a *Grimoire* and a *Distillation of Water* plus the new magic
relic: *Wadakkunnathan Temple Wax*. We couldn't get more money because
we couldn't defeat anyone in order to get those order points, it was better
this way, the guards have a nasty ability that lets them call an ally (another
guard) when they're on low HP and I'm not usually this lucky with the First Aid
checks!
