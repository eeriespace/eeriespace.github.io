occult* campaign using [Seekers Beyond The

[fourth]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/25/play-report-vice-and-virtue-tea-shop/) parts
of the campaign. 

## Friday, full moon - Day 5 at the Omphalos

Lana's goal for today is to consecrate one of the tools that she would need to
summon **Taavi**, so she heads to the Omphalos.

There, the same spy that informed her about these being dangerous times
[yesterday]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/25/play-report-vice-and-virtue-tea-shop/),
warns her again. Lana doesn't care about this since she should be safe today
performing rituals. ``Daily event: inside information`` 

She walks some more and comes across  **Keira**, the poison researcher that
[she rescued a couple of days
ago]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/11/play-report-the-poison-research-lab/), she
invites her to participate in a ceremony, which lasts a couple of hours. Lana
doesn't gain anything from it, but at least it seems that Keira doesn't find
her that useless anymore. ``Encounter: ceremony`` ``INT test``

> I use **Mythic GME** to know if Lana knew the person that invited her to the
> ceremony.

Lana buys some *Frankincense* and rents a ritual chamber for a total of 300ø to
perform the **Tool Consecration ritual**.

She lights some candles and tries to consecrate the athame
aaaaand...fails. ``Magic liturgy check`` 

> I roll 15, the goal was less than 10. Not that bad, but still a failure.

Lana goes home.

## Saturday, full moon - Day 6 at the Omphalos

Today there is a festive atmosphere at the Omphalos, the mages are throwing
black confetti everywhere, these Londoners sure like parting, it's the second
holiday in a week! It appears to be the day of Omphalos, which commemorates its
creation. ``Event: Omphale festival`` ``Double favour with the Orders``

> The objective was to continue doing consecration rituals, but I cannot ignore
> a double favour event!

Lana goes to a pub to meet her friends, and another drunk mage says something
offensive, but she doesn't think of anything intelligent to reply. ``INT test``

In the Hall of Orders she sees representatives from the Causa Scientiae, and
the Mesu-betesh, she goes to the Causa Scientiae since she is in better terms
with them. She is pleased to see that her friend Cecil has the day off, she had
to work on the previous holiday after all, and **Keith**, a friend of Cecil's
that [had an argument with Lana
before]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/27/play-report-the-egyptian-amulet/), is
managing the missions.

He tells her that they want to sabotage some strange business that is happening
at an abandoned industrial complex, apparently they are doing something with
the animals there (genetic engineering?) and the Causa Scientiae order wants to
cut their supply of Alchemical Stashes and Ritual Supplies. ``Mission:
sabotage`` ``Goal: 3 ``

> I use the **Tome of Adventure Design** to know more about the abandoned
> complex, and I get: "Animal Trainer (unusual animals)" and "Engineering
> (building)".

Lana accepts the mission.

<p align="center"><small>The sinister industrial complex</small></p>

## At the sinister industrial complex

### Main entrance

No enemies. There is a locked door, Lana opens it using her lock picks.
``Lockpicking check``

Lana doesn't find any Alchemical stash here.

### Hallway 1

There aren't any enemies. One fail safe is triggered by Lana, she is not hurt,
but she hears some explosions nearby. ``DEX test`` ``Rec room and rooms 1, 3
and 7 destroyed``

> This is bad, now I have fewer places to search for the stashes...

Lana doesn't find any Alchemical stash here either.

### Hallway 2

Nothing of interest in this hallway and no stash either.

### Hallway 3

No enemies on sight, the floor is full of dry blood and syringes, are they
drugging the animals? ``Event consequence: enemies -10 defence, +20HP``

> mmm I kind of don't mind this.

Lana finds an alchemy stash next to some garbage, there are two left to go.

> Great, good start!

### Office 2

A **Curator** (from an American spy agency that is tasked with researching the
occult) is calmly reading an Alchemical treaty, she ignores Lana. ``NPC
reaction: indifferent``

Lana hears more sounds, maybe they are some more Curator agents... she avoids
being found. ``Sneaking check``

Lana doesn't find any Alchemical stash here.

### Hallway 3

Lana goes back to this hallway, no enemies appear.

### Hallway 4

As she goes around the corner to get to the fourth hallway, another **Curator**
appears, he is hostile. ``NPC reaction: hostile``

Lana wins the engagement round and makes a first shot that hits the Curator,
then she uses her knife, but she is very clumsy and it falls to the ground. The
combat continues, the Curator scores three hits but Lana manages to kill him.

She loots his breath spray, "Surely these spies are always ready", a combat
knife, a Beretta and a pair of very cool knight vision goggles. The Curator is
also wearing a *Military grade armour*, but is too heavy for Lana to carry.

> I have yet to find if the night vision goggles would be useful, but they
> sound very cool already.

She tries to heal herself but she fails.

Lana doesn't find any Alchemical stash here either.

### Office 4

As Lana enters this office, a **Hinn** closes by. This is the first time that
Lana encounters these creatures, they're almost human but there is something
weird going on with their eyes.

The Hinn is not very strong, she manages to kill it in three turns and she
doesn't take any hits.

Lana loots the Hinn's Beretta and combat knife.

**A man with a baseball bat** has seen her combat against the Hinn and is eager
to blow off some steam fighting against Lana too. ``NPC reaction: hostile``
``NPC flavour: brutal, distracted, control``

She quickly retreats! ``DEX check``

She finds another stash!! And she is also able to heal herself. There is only
one stash left to go.

> Great combo!

### Hallway 4

Back to the hallway, an **Orisha Agent** greets her. ``NPC reaction: hostile``

The agent hits Lana twice, but after five turns Lana is able to kill her to
loot her Beretta.

## Office 5

There is a **Sect adept** organising some boxes in this office, she ignores
Lana. ``NPC reaction: indifferent`` 

There are some files that might be of interest here, Lana tries to understand
anything from the files, but they are too complex. ``Occult knowledge check``

She uses some time to heal her wounds.

## Hallway 4

Back to this hallway a **Rogue mage** has seen her reading the files in the
office, he is friendly and gives her a **MAGIC RELIC**, "Hey friend, it looks
like you've started with this occult magic and rituals thing recently, this
might help you."  The rogue mage gives her a *Warding chalk*, which would help
her performing rituals. Lana resists her urge to hug the mage. ``NPC reaction:
friendly``

> HOORAY! I can actually use this relic to get some bonus performing the ritual
> to summon Taavi!

## Hallway 6

Lana walks with a smile to this hallway when a crazy eyed **Street tough**
appears, he wants to steal her stuff, and she engages in combat. ``NPC
reaction: hostile``

It takes six rounds to kill the street tough, and he scores two hits in
Lana. She loots his Glock, and throws a combat knife away from her backpack,
she needs to prioritise the loot that sells for more obols.

> This time I remembered!

Lana doesn't find the last stash here, and she is unable to patch her wounds.

## Office 10

There is an old man, an **Ancient**, furiously typing on his laptop. He sees
Lana and mistakes her for someone else "Take this Grimoire, we need to use this
ritual to speed up the process". Lana takes the *Grimoire*. ``NPC reaction:
friendly``

> HERE WE GO!

The room is full of filling cabinets and blackboards with strange formulae, she
looks around and finds the cover of a book that looks familiar, it's another
*Grimoire*.  ``Perception check``

She also finds the last stash between two boxes.

> These last two locations have been great.

She takes some time to patch her wounds, she still needs to go back to the
exit, but she is unable to anything. 

However, she is able to exit this complex safely.

## Mission recap

> \*lots of colourful confetti flying around\*
>
> \*add some more confetti\*

* 150 favour x2: 300 favour with Causa Scientiae
* 500ø
* Selling the loot: a combat knife, three berettas, a glock (full price) ->
  2700ø
* Found two Grimoires
* Got her first Magic relic: *Warding Chalk*

> \*more confetti flying around\*

This has been a very fruitful mission!
