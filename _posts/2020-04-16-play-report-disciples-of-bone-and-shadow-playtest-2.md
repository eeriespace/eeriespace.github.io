improving, enhancing and changing everyday, thereby everything is subject to
change.

## New rule additions and mistakes that I've made

* I bought a lantern with no oil, I need to purchase some oil too, so I'll be
  buying 5 doses (25 jats total). Each dose lasts for a full cave or ruins
  exploration. 

* New ways to earn experience are implemented. We get 2XP per hex explored, so
  Eldara gets 12XP. 
  
  Other XP awarding feats are successfully casting a spell, disabling
  traps... this makes non-combat centred gameplay also very rewarding. I really
  like this addition.
  
## Previously...

Eldara was investigating some rumours about the dead coming back to life after
being buried, some people with strange energy emanating from their bodies and a
cult possibly related to all these happenings.

* Milestones: 0/4

## Some clarifications

The rules have a specific description of what a mission is, when I'm talking
here about Eldara's *mission* or *goal*, it is not a 'rulebook mission'. It is
just my way of expressing that 'Eldara has decided to do this'.

Milestones are just a way of counting how much have you progressed in your
journey and are not related to missions (rulebook mission).

## Part 2 of the adventure

<p align="center"><small>Hexes of the Madari region explored so far</small></p>

### Hex 55, Madari region

``Orientation test: no milestone`` ``No surprise``

Eldara sees some ruins in the distance. She doesn't think that they are the
cult's base but they emanate a strange energy, she will explore them just in
case. ``Augur: no, but``

Upon approaching the ruins she sees that they were buildings once part of a
small city, some buildings haven't collapsed naturally so she thinks that some
kind of war brought the demise of this settlement. ``Ruins purpose: small
city`` ``Ruins cause of demise: lost after internal strife``
``Ruins name: Lost Cells``

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eeriespace/public-images/master/20200416-play-report-disciples-narrative-playbook-playtest-2/ruins-lost-cells.png"></p>
<p align="center"><small>Lost Cells ruins site, north is up.</small></p>

**1.** Eldara enters the ruins and ends up in a small corridor. There are three
different exits that she can take: one to the north, another one to the south
and a door to the east. The door to the east is locked. She takes the path to
the north.

> Please note that the ruins are generated as you explore.

**2.** She reaches a room with a triangular shape, there is a strange crystal
on its centre.

She feels that the crystal has something to do with her goal, she feels the
same energy from before, so she comes closer an touches it. ``Augur: yes``

As she is closely examining the crystal, she sees some visions in it. She sees
a place and people with the strange energy, but the energy is
stronger. ``Are there people with the energy? Augur: yes, but``

Then she sees the surrounding area, she can more or less recognise the place,
but a strange entity appears and blocks the sight. ``Does she know the area?
Augur: yes, but``

The entity could be human but the crystal clouds for a moment and she cannot
confirm it. ``Is it human? Augur: likely, but``

The vision continues, she sees more dead coming back to life, then the visions
end. ``Are people coming back to life? Augur: yes``

She is troubled by what she has seen but she can endure it. ``WILL check``

She tries to remember where does she know the place from, but she can only
remember that the place was definitely in Madari. ``Is the place Madari? Augur:
almost certain`` 

There are two exists in this triangular room, one in the north and another one
in the south, she takes the north corridor, which turns to the right to then
find it blocked.

> The map layout is generated on the fly and in this moment in time the
corridor had no exits. 

She goes back to the triangular room and takes the exit to the south.

**3.** She finds herself in another triangular room, and a **Giant Spider
(Elite)** stands in her way. ``Not tainted``

> This enemy is very tough. It has a very high initiative: 18,  which will make
> running from it hard, moreover it has a special ability that gives us -2 on
> the initiative rolls. And it's poisoning.
>
> Eldara is also carrying the lantern, so she cannot carry her shield, she will
> using only her sword.

The Giant Spider is very dexterous and attacks first, Eldara cannot avoid its
attack. ``-10HP`` ``Poisoned`` She tries to escape, but the monster blocks her
path. ``Dodge test`` She can feel the poison affecting her old body. ``CON test
to get rid of poison fail`` ``-1HP poison``

> To escape you need to pass a Dodge skill test and a DEX test. If you fail
> combat restarts.

The Giant Spider is quicker this turn again and attacks Eldara, she parries the
monster's attack and tries to escape, she reaches the door but then the spider
realises what is she doing. ``Dodge test OK`` ``DEX test fail`` ``-1HP poison`` 

Eldara keeps being slower than the monster, it attacks her and she is unable to
avoid the attack ``-9HP``. She tries to escape again, this time she is
successful. ``Dodge test OK`` ``DEX test OK`` ``-1HP poison``

Eldara prepares herself to cast magic to get rid of the poison, she casts
*Cleanse poison* successfully ``+2XP``. Then she will need to patch up her
wounds, she takes uses some bandages ``+1HP`` ``-1 bandage`` ``First aid OK``

> I'm terrible at healing.

She doesn't feel better, so she uses some magic to do this too. She casts
*Cauterise* but fails, she has done something wrong ``+1 corruption``, she
insists and this time the spell works ``+11HP`` ``+2XP``

> **Edit:** The author has reminded me that you **can't** fail to cast a
> spell. The roll that I was making was a resistance roll against corruption,
> which I failed and that's why she gained corruption; the effects of the
> spell, in this case a *Cauterise*, will still fully apply. 
>
> This is another great example of why I'm completely useless at healing.

**2.** She goes back to the first triangular room, the one with the crystal,
but some **Madarian Rats (Vermin)** cut her escape (there are three).

Eldara is quicker than the rats and she uses this opportunity to sneak and
avoid combat, the rats are unaware of her presence. ``Sneak test OK``

She cannot patch her wounds. ``-1 bandage``

> Seriously? She has a 50 on First aid!

**1.** She goes back to the corridor from the entrance of the ruins, she can
try to smash the locked door open (she has no lock picks) or take the corridor
that does south. She takes this last option.

**4.** This room looks like an alchemy laboratory and picks up her curiosity,
she has been dealing with alchemy the majority of her life. She spends some
time going through the notes ``+1 alchemy``.

She finds some indications that some of these alchemical formulae could be the
source of the strange happenings, specially one related to 'extreme forceful
healing' ``Augur``

She takes some time to patch her wounds again but fails. ``-1 bandage``

**1.** Eldara goes to the locked door and tries to smash the door open. She
succeeds! *"My bones are going to hurt a whole week!"* ``STR test``

**5.** A pair of poisoning darts stab her in one arm and her thorax, her body
hasn't recovered from being poisoned not so long ago, so she cannot do anything
against the poison. ``CON test fail`` ``Trap, Perception test fail``

She uses some bandages ``+4HP`` ``-1 Bandage``

There is a locked door in the north, she smashes it open. ``STR test``

> It is funny how she can open all closed doors using only her strength! She
> has 10 points.

She walks through a zigzagging corridor, it branches to the north and west, the
west path ends up where a previous corridor was collapsed and she was unable
to pass through it, but from this side, it seems that she would be
capable. Since the west side was already explored she takes the north path and
reaches an oval room.

**6.** In this big oval room a **Crog (Elite)** appears. ``Tainted: Toxic``

This creatures are known as abominations. Crogs have humanoid appearance and
are easily scared, but that would make them hostile.

> This is another tough one. It has two attacks per turn and each successful
> attack deals Rot (causes -1 CON). Then due to the Toxic trait it causes
> poison, but Eldara is already poisoned. The good part is that it's initiative
> is low.

Eldara is quicker than this thing. She tries to sneak to the exit but the
creature catches a glimpse of her, she tries again, and this time the creature
completely discovers her. ``Sneak test fail + second sneak due to Stealthy
ability fail``

> \*facepalm\*

The abomination attacks and Eldara cannot avoid any of its attacks. ``-9HP``
``-2HP`` ``-1 CON`` ``-1HP poison``
> This should have been -2 CON and I forgot to stack the poison throughout all
> the combat.

She cannot go first this turn, but she parries both of the attacks form the
abomination, then she tries to escape but the monster is quick and doesn't let
her. ``Dodge test fail`` ``-1HP poison``

This time she goes first and fails yet again to escape. The abomination attacks
twice and she cannot parry any of its attacks ``-10HP`` ``-4HP`` ``-2 CON``
``-1HP poison``  ``Doge fail``

She goes first. Tries to escape, and she fails in the last minute, the
abomination catches up to her. It attacks and she parries both of its
attacks. ``Dodge OK, DEX fail`` ``-1HP poison``

The abomination goes first, she critically parries one of its attacks, but
fails the second one. Then she is unable to escape. ``-16HP`` ``-1 CON`` ``Doge
fail`` ``-1HP poison``

The fight goes on, she is quicker this turn, but fails yet again to escape. She
parries one of the attack, but the second one lands, and Eldara falls to the
ground, the last gasp of life disappearing from her eyes. ``-12 HP`` ``-1
CON`` ``-1HP poison``


## Recap

* So Eldara died. She hadn't reached any milestones of the mission, but she
  had good clues and cool things to do and explore. It's a pity but it is just
  that I had terrible luck with that last enemy.
  
  Eldara's sneaking skill is high (50), so I have good chances of running away
  from combat if the enemy's initiative is not that high, which in this case,
  it wasn't. When you have to run away in-combat Eldara has fewer chances since
  it uses the Dodge skill, which she only has at (26). I was extremely lucky to
  get those two chances to run away from the Giant Spider in the beginning, but
  then my luck ran out when I stumbled upon the Crog.
  
  The rule of "how to escape combat when already in-combat" came after I rolled
  my character  (previously you could only run if you won the engagement round
  and then you need to succeed in a sneaking skill check reducing the enemy's
  awareness) so she was definitely lacking in that part, and ultimately my
  strategy to make a sturdy character (aka run easily from everything and then
  heal) failed.
  
* Also, not being able to use a shield since she needs to carry the lantern in
  that hand is another big handicap.

* *But*, I was using a different set of dice to the ones that I usually use, so
  I think that I'm going back to the old ones and leave this set resting a bit.

* I'll roll a very different character next time!
