Play report of the fourth session of *Lana Vanne's ascension to the occult*
campaign using [Seekers Beyond The
Shroud](https://blackoathgames.com/seekers-beyond-the-shroud).

[third]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/11/play-report-the-poison-research-lab/) parts
of the campaign. 

## Thursday, first quarter - Day 4 at the Omphalos

Lana tries today to do some shopping, since [yesterday the shops were
closed]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/11/play-report-the-poison-research-lab/), as
she passes through the main entrance, a man in a hoodie carefully walks towards
her; he is an spy from the Causa Cientiae order and warns her about some
talking that has been made recently, dangerous times are coming. ``Daily event:
inside information`` ``+10 defensive skills for the next mission``

There is a crowd next to an unknown woman to Lana, but apparently she is well
known. Lana tries to pass through the multitude, but there are too many
people. ``CHA test``

The Hall of Orders has made a slow start after yesterday's holiday and only the
Causa Cientiae and the Kadmonites have their representatives, since Lana
doesn't see her friend Cecil in the Causa Cientiae stand, she goes to the
Kadmonites. There, a middle aged woman, with rugged looks and sun burnt skin
welcomes her. Her name is **Mary** and she warns her that the upcoming mission
would be difficult (as the spy already told Lana), she is to stop a cell of
occult terrorists that have one of their bases on an abandoned tea house, Vice
& Virtue. ``Mission: Occult Terrorists``

> I rolled Mary's appearance using **Knave's** character creation tables, then
> the  **Tome of Adventure Design** to know what the abandoned complex where
> this mission takes place would be, I get "Tea shop or restaurant".

Before setting off, Lana goes around the different shops to buy the materials
needed to summon **Taavi** and to resupply before the mission.

She buys more *bandages*, a *light kevlar armour* (a freaking failed chimera
chewed and ruined her old armour in the [previous
mission]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/11/play-report-the-poison-research-lab/)) the
ritual tools (*athame, chalice, wand* and a *pentacle*) and a *ritual
robe*. She will need to consecrate those (or at least try) but that's the plan
for some other day.

## At the Vice & Virtue tea shop

### Main entrance

No enemies on first sight, but some shadowy visions overwhelm Lana, doubt
hovers over her... and she manages to get a hold of herself and
continue. ``WILL test``

There are bodies hanged on the wall, they've been killed a while ago, they're
no longer warm. Lana searches the bodies and founds a lighter, some disturbing
children photos (she is happy that the waste of space of a man is dead), and
3ø.

### Room 1

The first terrorist shows up, is a **Rogue Mage**, Lana prepares for combat.

The mage is quicker, and shots Lana, but she manages to avoid the shot. She
shots the mage, it does not hit. Lana acts first this time, shots and fails,
she dodges the enemy's shot. The Rogue mage goes first, shots Lana and hits
her, Lana also scores a hit. In the next round Lana avoids the shots, but she
doesn't hit the mage. The mage acts first again, shots Lana and the pain almost
paralyses her, but she shots and hits the mage. This round Lana acts first, she
shots but doesn't hit the mage, the mage shots and the pain paralyses Lana. She
loses this turn, but avoids the incoming attack. She then avoids the next shot
from the mage and shots him one last time, he is dead.

> I think that from now on I will not write the full combat log until something
> striking is happening.

Lana loots the body taking the *Sai*, a *Glock* and an *Antidote*, the mage has
also 10ø.

Then, she uses some *bandages* to patch her wounds.
> See that? I could heal her at the first try!

### Room 2

There aren't any enemies, but a somewhat archaic security measure, a tripwire,
activates some bombs, Lana reacts quickly and she is not harmed, but 3
locations are destroyed. ``DEX test`` ``Parking loot, Room 4 and Room 8
destroyed``

> This is good since now I have less rooms to search!

Looking around the rubble, Lana finds a strongbox, but she is unable to open
it. ``Lockpiking check``

She wants to patch her wounds a little more, but it is no use.
> Okay, this is more normal.

### Hallway 2

Another **Rogue Mage** appears, attracted by the ruckus that Lana has made.

This Mage only scores a single blow on Lana, an improvement compared to than
the last one, and she wins the combat (this time Lana combats on close quarters
since she is better with melee defensive skills even if her attack is lower).

She is unable to patch her wounds.

> This is becoming a problem.

### Hallway 3

No enemies in this hallway, but **a man that smells of "Private security"**
stops her, he is not violent and the beginning, but he doesn't buy Lana's story
and switches to a combat pose. ``NPC reaction: unfriendly`` ``Persuasion  check``
``NPC flavour: weak, chain smoker, knowledge``

She manages to kill the private security guard, taking some damage. The private
security guy had some common currency that is useless for Lana, and she cannot
get any more weight into her rucksack, so she lefts the guard's gear.

> Writing this play report now I realise that I should have dropped the sai-s

> after work that day 

She is unable to patch her wounds.
> LANA, STOP BEING SO DAMN CLUMSY!
>
> I can think of the second title once she gets her second Rank with an Order:
*Lana Vanne, Who Hates Chimeras, Butterfingers.. Oh Wait! But She Has DEX 17*

### Recreation room

No enemies in the recreation room, but Lana discovers a prisoner that is
handcuffed and she is unable to release the man.

She patches her wounds a bit.
> Here we go! But it is not enough.

### Hallway 3

This hallway is silent...

### Room 3

No enemies but a woman appears and stops Lana. Lana tells her that she is
looking for the restroom (after all, this is a big complex) and that she is a
new recruit and that she is a bit lost. The woman believes her. ``Persuasion
check``

> I don't roll for the NPC traits, only the genre, unless they become hostile.

She patches her wounds a little.

> Still not enough \*whistles\*

### Hallway 3

Another **Rogue mage** appears. 

Lana takes two hits and kills the mage after six hits, she is seriously
wounded.

She takes a mini led flashlight from the corpse.

> OK. I think that this is the time to retreat, she is at 25HP and she cannot
> use any more First aids in the locations that she's been, since I've already
> tried to heal her at every location.

No enemies found going back to the entrance!

## Mission recap

Mary from the Kadmonites is not pleased with the results.

* -50 favour with the Kadmonites
* Selling the loot I get: two sais at full price; two Glock 17s, one at full
  price, and a Beretta at full price -> 1800ø
  
Well, I've lost some favour, but I could sell the loot for some obols, not that
bad. These "extermination" missions are still not for my character, she is too
weak for those.
> They're not my cup of tea (haha bad pun, sorry).

I think that I would need to get some potions or restorative
magic before attempting a mission like this again. I also should have retreated
after the first NPC encounter (after the second rogue mage), since I got lucky
going back to the exit, but if the character would have encountered another
enemy things would have turned bad. Very bad.
