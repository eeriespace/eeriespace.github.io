This play report is the second session of my
**[Mothership RPG](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/mothership)** solo
campaign, where my main character and their background is introduced.

You can read previous sessions here:
[1st]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/29/play-report-faust-cherubim-king-10-704/).

## The main character

I roll the non-class skills randomly, plus the gender.

**Name:** Nyx (female)

**Class:** Teamster

**Stats:** strength 39, speed 39, intellect 43, combat 22

**Skills:** first aid, zero-g, mechanical repair, piloting, rimwise

**Trinket:** stress ball, with the phrase *Zero stress in zero-G*

**Patch:** a medic patch

So she knows a bit of everything, and she needs a reason to be at the
[Faust-C]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/29/play-report-faust-cherubim-king-10-704/)
space station, the most obvious reason is money, so she will have a dept of d% x 
10000 credits. That makes a debt of 56000 credits.

Having the first aid skill and a medic patch could indicate that she had
some medical training before, but she also knows a lot about zero-g, piloting,
repairing, and about far away colonies. So I think that she is going to be some
kind of pilot, and that she knows all about those skills since she is used to
maintaining her ship, and that focus on medical skills is because she was
a captain very concerned about the safety and health of her crew. Since she has
a lot of dept, she has lost her ship because of something that we don't know
already and now is doing odd jobs at the station.

## Putting it all together

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eeriespace/public-images/master/20200330-play-report-mothership-frozen-dreams/mothership-faust-c-frozen-dreams.png)

Nyx is a transport pilot reconverted to mechanic that works for the external
engineering division of **Faust-C** station. She lost her ship a while ago and
has been drowning in debt ever since.

Her experience with vac-suits and mechanical knowledge repairing her now lost
ship was able to land her a job in this station, but she is barely capable of
making ends meet.

She has been spending long hours repairing the massive **Energy Transfer
Mirrors (ETMs)** that orbit around the station, they are part of the stealth
subsystems of the station and are needed to hide the energy readings of the
station so that it can remain undetected. The ETMs have a clever design, they
work in pairs and orbit around the station. Every mirror has its pair in the
opposite direction that transfers the energy from its side to its opposing
side. This way, if someone scans the space around the station, they would pick
credible data.

But they haven't been working quite well recently. After a long shift of space
walking and running diagnostics in the mirrors, Nyx heads to her favourite
AR-bar (augmented reality bar), **Frozen Dreams**, where you put some glasses
on or connect yourself if you have cyberware, and enjoy a meal or have a drink
while relaxing in an scenery of your choosing. There are also some other types
of entertainment regarding AR in the station, but Nyx doesn't have a taste for
them.

As she is finishing her noodles with some artificially grown meat, someone
grabs her shoulder to gain her attention. 

He is someone that Nyx knows from an acquaintance, but she is unable to
remember when she meet the man. He is bald, and somewhere around his fifties,
but Nyx thinks that he looks older than he really is, maybe he has a very
physically demanding job...

He tells her that people from the block (oh, he is a neighbour from the same
block in sector that she lives), have noticed that her night shift has been
reduced and whether she is well.

Here in **Faust-C** you pay for the time you spent on your bunk, and an extra
if you want some storage space for your change of clothes or personal
items. These residential blocks are controlled by some mafias and the
daily cost of the bunk and storage spaces depends on the hours that people use
them. The buildings have fixed expenses each month and the cost of the services
that it offers (bunks, storage, cleaning facilities, water) is a simple
division of the total monthly cost by the number of usage hours. So if people
sleep less hours on the building, the rent would be higher. Mafias will
not lose credits if the building is empty so the tenants will need to cope with
the cost or live on the streets. The "citizens" of Faust-C rent quarters with
people sleeping more or less same amount of hours.

Nyx knows that the man is worried about the credits, not her, but well, she
wouldn't care about the man either. She tells him that she is putting some
extra hours at work to save up some credits. The block neighbour tells her that
he knows of some people that would like to hire a jack-of-all-trades and that
she could maybe do it in her *spare* time.

Life in the station is organised by three shifts: working, sleeping and spare
time (which is usually second-work-time for many people), Nyx has two shifts of
work and has been working some extra hours that take time from her sleep shift.

Nyx is interested in what the neighbour is offering, she would like to earn
more credits in her spare time (second work time) than she is making now. They
exchange terminal IDs. The man's username is **Theora**, she will call him that
from now on.

Theora tells her that he will sent her the details later, and that she should
*rest* now.

Convinced by Theora, she finishes her noodles, and heads to the residential
sector.
