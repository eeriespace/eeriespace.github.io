## Monday, new moon - Day 29 at the Omphalos

Lana enters in the Omphalos, it looks like any other day but the same
unwelcoming and ungrateful man that asked her an *athame* before and looked
down on her because she hadn't consecrated one is back, and is asking random
strangers for the same thing. *'I have a consecrated athame'* Lana thinks *'but
I am NOT going to sell it'*. She is feeling very proud of herself and walks
with a smile on her face when a member of the Causa Scientiae comes towards her
and gives her a tip about possible dangers that could be lurking in a mission
and asks her to be careful.  ``Encounter: a man in need`` ``Event: inside info``
``+10 defensive skills``

> I'm going to take another mission instead of continuing with the consecration
> rituals to make the most of this defensive bonus.

There are representatives from the Causa Scientiae and the Kadmonites in the
Hall of Orders. Lana's reputation after [Mary's
death]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/27/play-report-more-than-a-week-of-magic-ritual-training/)
is not good with the Kadmonites, and she wants to make amends; she walks
towards their stand. Mary's substitute is a gaunt looking woman with a
leaf-green mohawk and a pristine suit. 

> I use **Knave's** character generator for this.

Lana introduces herself and the woman flinches, she has recognised her
name. She composes herself and tells Lana that she is **Annabella Doyle**. She
wants her to make a pact with a spirit in the astral domain, a
vestige. ``Mission: spirit pact (astral)`` ``16 stages``

> *'An astral mission is not what I'm expecting, it would be my first, but
> since we can't die in the astral and we have the +10 to our defence we should
> be alright, and we can always run away from combat.'* that is what I thought,
> but turns out that we can't run away from enemies in the astral...

Annabella hands her a *Potion of Astral Travel* and accompanies her to their
meditation room. Lana tries to enter the astral by meditation, but she fails,
so she takes the potion. ``Meditation check fail``

> I don't know if this is legal (Edit: it is)

## In the Astral: The Rotten Woods

> So, in the astral we use SP instead of HP which is great since Lana has 115
> SP and 110 HP; we use our psychic attack & defence skills in combat, which is
> 50 for both skills in our case, but due to that +10 defence, we have 60 for
> psychic defence so not that bad at all.

### Stage 1

Lana wakes up in an eerie forest, the leaves on trucks of the trees are
rotting, everything smells of decay. It's her first time here but she thinks
that it is beautiful.

> I imagine this forest as the Red Forest from the 12 Monkeys series, go watch
> it if you haven't!!

As she is contemplating the landscape, a **Spirit** levitates towards her, it
has evil intentions.

Lana deploys a barrier using her Psychic defence and uses bursts of energy with
her Psychic offence to try to drive the spirit back. Even if she is doing great
for her first combat and her first time in the astral the spirit is very
sturdy, the battle prolongs, its now a matter of resilience. Lana is very badly
injured, her barrier wasn't strong enough to stop five attacks (``-18, -28,
-21, -30, -11``), but slowly and steadily she scores hit after hit to the
Spirit and finally drives it off.  ``Stage: enemy``

> Holy moly. We are at 7SP. This is just he first stage (out of 16,
> *sixteen*!!) and I can't even try to heal her since I don't have any magic
> that does that. Sh\*t we are doomed.
>
> But!! we cannot die here, so let's see this as an acclimatization exercise or
> something and see how far we can get.

### Stage 2

> So, in the astral we roll a d4 for each stage and that tells us how many path
> Options do we have. For each option we roll a d6 and it gives us a result
> (Enemy, Event or Discovery). 
>
> I'm going to try to avoid all the Enemies, hahaha.

``Path options: event``

The forest turns black and the darkness surrounds her. ``-10 combat skills``
``Event: darkness surrounds you``

> We are doomed in the next combat. Definitely.

### Stage 3

``Path options: enemy, discovery``

Lana becomes lost in herself, the forest is darker, she is walking in a tight
space, she sees two different paths... which one is the good one? ``Sanity
maximum -10`` ``Discovery: the abyss``

> Oh my!

### Stage 4

``Path options: enemy x2, event x2``

Somehow Lana feels better thinking about a possible future life were she is
happy. ``Skip next stage`` ``Event: shortcut!``

> YESSSSSSSSS

### Stage 5

(skip)

### Stage 6

``Path options: event, enemy x2, discovery``

Lana enters into a shop in the middle of the forest, it is a tailor's workshop,
there are a lot of clothes laying around, but Lana is attracted to a headscarf,
she takes it. ``Skip next enemy encounter`` ``Discovery: spirit shroud`` 

> THANK YOU!!

### Stage 7

``Path options: enemy x2``

Lana is able to pass unnoticed through the enemies thanks to her spirit
headscarf.

> YESSSSSS

### Stage 8

``Path options: event, discovery, enemy x2``

Lana wanders along the streets of a red city, good memories accompany
her. ``Ignore next sanity lost`` ``Discovery: good memory``

> I have this magic relic that absorbs up to 200 sanity lost so Lana was
> already good enough on that point, but if I can make the relic last longer
> better for me. 

### Stage 9

``Path options: enemy, discovery x2, event``

There is a fountain with the most transparent water that Lana has ever seen, it
turns out that it is pure *vril* instead of water. Lana drinks it. ``INT test
OK`` ``Recover 50 VP`` ``Discovery: fountain``

> Lana is incapable of using magic, but well, everything good is welcomed.

### Stage 10

``Path options: enemy, discovery x2, event``

The forest is left behind and Lana enters what seems to be a throne room. She
sees a crown and she takes it. ``Offensive skills +10 vs angels/demons``
``Discovery: the crown``

> I hope that we don't have to use those offensive skills.

### Stage 11

``Path options: enemy x3, event`` 

> I thought that I was done here, 3 enemies in a row before a non-combat path
> option appeared.

The forest is back, but is not the same, Lana feels a strange sensation and the
air feels weird. ``Bound spirits banished`` ``Event: banished``

> Woah! This event is the absolute worst. If I had a bound spirit I would be
> very angry at this event woa. The astral is veeery mean.

### Stage 12

``Path options: event``

Lana finds another shortcut! ``Skip next stage`` ``Event: shortcut``

### Stage 13

(skip)

### Stage 14

``Path options: discovery x2``

Lana is surrounded again by darkness, she is terrified and feels ill
inside. There are two paths again to choose from ``-4 sanity (ignored by the
discovery at stage 8)`` ``Discovery: the abyss``

### Stage 15

``Path options: discovery x2, event x2``

Lana continues her way, there is a bottomless hole just in her path and some
creature with tentacles attacks her. ``WIL test
fail`` ``-9HP``

> I thought that this was a typo and the book should say *SP* instead of *HP*
> but I asked in the discord and it was indeed HP. Otherwise we would have
> failed the mission here since Lana is only at 7SP.

### Stage 16

The spirit that Lana was looking for appears, a **Vestige**. She tries to
persuade it talking about her strength overcoming the astral travel half
dead. ``Persuasion check OK!!``

> HOLY F\*\*\* we did it! Here is a picture of my lovely dice passing the
> persuasion check!!! They rock!!
>
> Also, this is why I don't pass first aid checks, my luck is spent
> everywhere else.

## Mission recap

* +10 order points
* +150 favour with the Kadmonites
* 500Ã¸
* WE ARE STILL ALIVE AND KICKING!

I am thrilled. We did it! This was very stressing but also very funny since I
knew that we couldn't die in the astral, that was reassuring. I laughed a lot
and had a couple of critical moments when the d4 of the path options rolled
lower numbers and I was hoping to get anything but an enemy. This was very fun,
but the astral is very difficult at this point for my character. Also, I think
that I prefer non-astral missions since I usually encounter NPCs and there is a
bit of interaction, but well, I'm glad that we have tried it and survived.
