 parts of the campaign. 

## Sunday, first quarter - Day 7 at the Omphalos

An enemy has followed Lana from the industrial complex that she visited
yesterday, it is a **Failed Chimera**. ``Daily event: attack``

> Sh*t. Well, I wont encounter any more enemies today and she's at full health,
> let's give it a go.

Lana prepares herself for the fight, she hates these creatures so much and she
believes to be in an advantageous position, so she intends to kill it. The
chimera is quicker in the first round, but Lana is able to fire a shot (that
fails) before it comes any closer; then the chimera attacks, and Lana deviates
its claws granting her an opportunity to use her knife against the creature,
then is her turn to attack but fails.

The chimera comes for a second round, but Lana is quicker, and very clumsy, her
knife falls to the ground, the chimera uses this time to bite her, the saliva
destroys Lana's *kevlar armour* and the pain paralyses her.

> Buffffffff.....

Lana gets a hold of herself and picks the knife from the ground, the chimera
attacks again an makes more damage. Now Lana is armed again, she parries the
chimera's attack, but fails to connect her swing to make damage to the
creature. The chimera goes again, but Lana has learned her lesson an critically
parries the blow, doing some damage to the creature, then fails her attack. The
chimera's attacks go on an on, she parries them but is left too tired to
connect her attacks. She manages to be quicker than the creature, successfully
attacks and parries the chimera's blow. She is quicker again, but fails her
attack and the parry, the pain paralyses her yet again. The chimera attacks,
she avoids the blow. The creature attacks again, but it fails to hit her, Lana
makes a critical blow that paralyses the creature, and in the next turn she
kills in making a desperate last attack.

> I was this close to losing her. I hereby declare that I will **not** attempt
> to fight anything with +20 on the attacks. Holy moly. She is at 7HP now, I
> could have lost her, now that I have a lot of grimoires! I need to be much
> more careful. Holy cow.

> (One minute later) I FREAKING KILLED A FREAKING CHIMERA

Lana arrives to the Omphalos bleeding profusely and almost death, but somehow
she is proud of herself.

There is a big crowd of people near a supplies shop, but she doesn't care
anymore. ``Encounter: celebrity`` ``CHA test``

She heads to the alchemical and ritual supplies shop, where she buys some
*Frankincense* for 100ø and then rents a ritual chamber for 200ø. Before
entering to the chamber she also buys another *Light kevlar armour* for 1000ø,
this is the second time that a Chimera destroys her armour.

At the ritual chamber she tries to consecrate the athame
aaaaaand... fails. ``Magic liturgy check``

She has done enough for the day and heads home.

## Monday, first quarter - Day 8 at the Omphalos

There are more people walking around by the Omphalos today, no wonder, the
alchemical labs and ritual chambers are free for the day! ``Event: free
services``

Lana heads to the ritual chambers but she sees a suspicious headed figure, she
decides to follow them, and somehow it seems that they're planing some shady
business indeed, some kind of attack to the Omphalos. She reports this fact to
the security guards and the culprit sect, the **Covenant of the Glorious
Dawn**, will surely remember her name.  ``+50 favour with all orders``
``Antagonist: Covenant of the Glorious Dawn``

> I need to re-read the rules regarding antagonists.

She buys a *Frankincense* and tries to perform the *Tool consecration ritual*
once again aaaaand... fails. ``Magic liturgy check``

> I rolled a 11, not that bad. There is still hope.

## Tuesday, full moon - Day 9 at the Omphalos

**Ezra** a famous mind healer is in town, but Lana doesn't require his
services. ``Event: Ezra the mind mender``

Since Lana hasn't taken any missions in a couple of days, strange rumours are
flying around, she takes some time to speak about her most recent deeds and
exploits, she now own a powerful magic relic, she has recently defeated a
chimera and she is going to reach Rank I with the Causa Scientiae. ``Event:
rumours`` ``CHA test``

She buys another *Frankincense*, rents a ritual chamber and tries to perform
the ritual aaaand... fails. ``Magic liturgy check``

## Wednesday, full moon - Day 10 at the Omphalos

There is a ruckus when Lana arrives early in the morning, everyone is agitated,
an Order sent some people to a mission yesterday and they have just arrived,
badly injured. One of them is **Mary**, the woman with sun burnt skin from the
Kadmonites. One of her colleagues tells Lana that they need her to perform some
first aid before the medic arrives, otherwise Mary would die. Lana takes a pair
of *bandages* from her rucksack, but it is futile. Mary dies. ``Event:
wounded`` ``First aid check``

> Even if a miracle would have happened, Mary was at a great disadvantage
> hoping to be saved by my luck on First aid checks...
>
> I have a separate sheet where I keep track of the NPCs that Lana is
> encountering, I had 7, so I rolled and Mary showed up.

Lana stays a couple of minutes with the companions of Mary, trying to console
them and then heads for the ritual chamber, when she realises that someone has
token advantage of the chaos and has stolen 100ø from her. ``Encounter``

She buys the *frankincense* and rents a chamber, lights some candles, performs
the incantations aaaaand... the ritual fails. ``Magic liturgy check``

> Regardless of the failure, I can now make a skill roll-up, which is
> successful! *Magic liturgy* is now at 11.

## Thursday, third quarter - Day 11 at the Omphalos

Yesterday's death has made some problems to arise, so all the Orders are
assembled in a private meeting. ``Event: order dispute``

Some idiots from the Kadmonites are criticising Lana's performance regarding
yesterday's events, but Lana is able to shut their mouths. They apologise and
lend her their ritual chamber for free for the day. ``Encounter: taking
offence``  ``INT test``

She buys a *frankincense* and tries the ritual again aaaand... fails.

## Friday, third quarter - Day 12 at the Omphalos

The merchants of the Omphalos need to readjust their prices since there is too
much stock and not enough people buying, so everything is 10ø cheaper. ``Event:
lower prices`` 

Lana takes advantage of today's prices and buys 10 *frankincenses* and 10
*bandages*, she will eventually need all of those.

The idiots from the Kadmonites order have not learnt their lesson and are still
criticising Lana, but she has the upper hand and wins the argument. They let
her use their research facilities as an apology. ``Event: taking offence``
``INT test`` 

Lana uses one of the already bought *frankincenses* and performs the ritual in
the Kadmonites ritual chamber aaaaaand... fails.

## Saturday, new moon - Day 13 at the Omphalos

It seems that today is an special day at the Omphalos, everybody is summoning
and doing rituals, apparently the timing will be perfect. ``Event: the Omphalos
at work``

> Is good to know that this event exists.

Cecil, Lana's friend from the Causa Scientiae Order, greets her, its been a
long time since she has seen her, Lana tells her that she's been trying to
consecrate some tools for a summoning ritual, but that it hasn't been going
well. Cecil invites her to a ritual, that way Lana may gain some
experience. Lana joins her and learns something. ``Encounter ceremony`` ``INT
test`` ``Magical liturgy +1``

> This is also good! Now Magical liturgy is at 12.

She goes yet another day to the ritual chamber, pays the rent fee, takes one of
the *frankincenses* from her rucksack, performs the ritual aaaaand... it fails.

## Sunday, new moon - Day 14 at the Omphalos

Today is a calm day, nothing is going on. ``Event: calm day``

There are some people that are speaking badly about her since it has been a
while since she has taken a mission. She cannot say anything about
it. ``Encounter: taking offence`` ``INT test``

This is the last time that Lana can attempt to consecrate one of the ritual
tools, she would need to run some missions to get more obols tomorrow. She
rents the ritual chamber, recites the words aaaaaand... fails.

> Well, it isn't that bad, I can attempt another skill roll-up when the next
> ritual attempt is made. I'm aiming to get to get this skill higher without
> using the Magic Relic that Lana has (which gives a +10) to preserve it for
> something more important. It will take a while but that is the plan.

## Week +1 day recap

* Defeated a Failed Chimera.
* Went up two points in the *Magical liturgy* skill.
* Bought a lot of bandages and  *frankincenses* at lower price.
* Mary from the Kadmonites died.
* Lana is now an antagonist of the Covenant of the Glorious Dawn.

She needs to take more missions to fund her ritual research activities, she is
running low on obols, and maybe she can reach Rank I with the Causa Scientiae
Order soon.
