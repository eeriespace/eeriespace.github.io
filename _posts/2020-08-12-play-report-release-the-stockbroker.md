parts of the campaign.
 
## Thursday, full moon - Day 25 at the Omphalos

The shop's of the Omphalos are on sale again and Lana buys her usual stuff:
bandages and *frankincenses*; as she is exiting the pharmacy she perceives a
suspicious person trying to blend in, they aren't doing it well enough,
everybody else is on high spirits due to the sale and is carrying a lot of
goods, they have a gloomy face and they're empty handed. Lana decides to alert
the guards and they take the suspicious person for questioning.  ``Event: lower
prices!`` ``Encounter: suspicious figure``
``+50 favour with all orders`` ``Antagonist: Sons of Yaldaboth``

> Lana's antagonist list has added a new member, we are now hated by: the
> Covenant of the Glorious Dawn, the Cult of the Dying Sun, and this new cult.

Lana decides to try to raise her ritual knowledge skills and tries to
consecrate a *chalice*, she rents a ritual chamber, lights a *frankincense*
aaaaaaand... fails. ``Magic Liturgy check fail`` 
``Skill roll-up fail`` 

> Buuuuu I rolled a 4 for the roll-up when I needed to roll higher than 13.

Lana tries to calm herself meditating before wrapping up her day.
``Meditation OK`` ``Recover 3 sanity``

## Friday, full moon - Day 26 at the Omphalos

There are fewer people than yesterday walking around, Lana wonders if another
order conflict has arisen, but it is just high prices.
``Event: high prices`` 

She sees another suspicious person walking around, this time they are carrying
a lot of bags *'They're so stupid'* Lana thinks. She reports again to the
guards. ``Encounter: suspicious figure`` ``+50 favour with all orders`` 
``Antagonist: True Sons of Yaldabaoth``

> We were already hated by those. Haters gonna hate.

Lana continues with her ritual training schedule, rents a ritual chamber, tries
a consecration ritual aaaaaaand... fails. ``Magic Liturgy fail``

## Saturday, third quarter - Day 27 at the Omphalos

As she enters the Omphalos she can feel everybody's attention focused on her,
**Cecil** tells her that they are bad mouthing her since she took the glory of
someone else's assassination [in the last
mission]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/09/play-report-eye-for-an-eye-assassination-for-the-causa-scientiae/),
*'Well, that rumour is actually true, isn't it?'* Lana replies. ``CHA test
fail`` ``-50 favour with all orders`` ``Encounter: rumours``

> This isn't that bad since we have already earned +100 favour with the spies
> that we uncovered the past two days.

She heads to the ritual chamber, she is feeling powerful today. ``Event:
tapping a ley line``

Tries to consecrate a chalice aaaaand... fails. ``Magic Liturgy fail``

## Sunday, third quarter - Day 28 at the Omphalos

The Omphalos is fully packed today, they're celebrating the day of the goddess,
Omphale. ``Event: Omphale festival`` 
``Missions grant double favour``

As she is walking towards the hall of the orders she is greeting friends
and getting small bites of free food, then she collides with a man, they both
apologise, and Lana continues her way, later she realises that she has been
pick-pocketed. ``Encounter: pickpocket`` ``-3ø``

There are representatives from the Causa Scientiae and The Siddha
today. She doesn't know the representative from the Causa Scientiae, Cecil and
Keith must be on vacation, so she goes to the Siddha, there **Paek Ja-Ok**
greets her.

She has a sensitive mission for her, they need her to rescue
**Katriin Mets**, an Estonian stockbroker (aka money launderer, Lana thinks)
that is usually employed by all the orders of the Omphalos to handle their
finances with 'normal' money, which they still need, but the Siddha want her
exclusivity since she is good. Very good. Katriin is being held in an abandoned
laundry building (Lana tries very hard to avoid laughing), the Siddha want her
to rescue Katriin and to convince her to join the order. ``Mission: rescue``
``Search 16``

> I used a random nationality, name and job generator. Then I used my **Tome of
> Adventure Design** to get a random town building.
>
> This mission will only give us half favour if we cannot convince Katriin to
> join the Siddha, but since we have the Omphale festival event aka double
> favour, we are guaranteed the normal amount of favour if we manage to finish
> the mission, so not bad at all!

## At the abandoned laundry building

### Main Entrance - Ground floor

As Lana enters the old laundry, she hits herself with an old crate that was
laying around, *'It won't come anything good out of this'* Lana thinks. ``-50%
healing`` ``Event: infected wounds``

### Parking lot - Ground floor

She goes first to the parking lot, but the door is locked; she tries to open it
with her lockpicking toolkit but she is unable. ``Lockpicking check fail``
``Event: locked door``

### Hallway 1 - Ground floor

She enters the first hallway, it is silent.

### Hallway 2 - Ground floor

As she turns in the corner to take the second hallway, she sees a **Street
Tough** walking towards her. The tough seems to be carrying stolen goods and
fears that Lana would take them from her ``NPC reaction hostile``

Lana prepares for combat, she takes a couple of hits but she is able to
neutralise the woman. ``-30HP`` Lana takes a knife and a glock from the corpse,
she searches the body, she has a bag with human hair and as she realises what
is it, she throws it to the ground.

> ugh.. why????

She tries to patch her wounds a little, but fails. ``First aid check fail``

### Office 3 - Ground floor

She enters in the first office, a **Hunter** is sharpening his knife, he smiles
and prepares for combat. ``NPC reaction hostile``

The hunter is quicker and injures her in the first round, she pre-emptively
flees from him. ``-16HP``

As she is exiting the room an old journal catches her eye, it looks like the
tales of someone but there is some hidden knowledge that Lana is able to
understand. ``INT (-2) test OK`` ``+5 Occult knowledge`` ``+5 Sanity``
``Discovery: old journal``

She rests for a bit to tend her wounds. ``First aid check OK!!!``  ``+6HP
(half)``

> Hell yeah!

### Hallway 2 / Hallway 4 - Ground floor

These hallways are empty and silent. Lana takes some more time to patch her
wounds but she is unable. ``First aid check fail``

### Hallway 5 - Ground floor

This hallway is also empty, Lana starts searching for **Katriin** at this
point.

She rests for a couple of minutes and applies more bandages to her
wounds. ``First aid check OK!`` ``+10HP (half)``

### Hallway 3 - Ground floor

As Lana enters another hallway a **Daeva** comes out from hiding in the
shadows. She tries to sneak without being seen, but the Daeva catches her. She
fails her parry but in the next turn flees. ``Sneaking check fail`` ``Sneaking
roll-up fail``.

She catches her breath and applies more bandages to her wounds, the bandages do
nothing. ``First aid fail``

The woman is not in this hallway.

### Office 2 - Ground floor

There is **a man wearing gym clothes** in this room slowly but steadily
flexing his biceps, he is hostile. ``NPC flavour: always wins initiative, +5
defence`` ``Gym manager: brass knuckles, glock 17, energy drink``

Lana is pissed off by the man's attitude, so she decides that she will fight
him. She parries the gym guy's attacks, manages to score critical hits which
cause bleeding and paralysis to the man, he also is able to hurt Lana, but at
the end she prevails. 

She loots the *brass knuckles*, the *glock* and the *energy drink*, then she
searches the body, the man had something valuable on him, an *alchemical
treatise*! 

> The brass knuckles are veeery cool, d10+25 damage, Lana is going to use them
> right away, and of course, the alchemical treatise is good as well!

``Event: who are you?``

She looks around the office, it is very dark, they, whoever *they* are have
performed a very dark ritual here, Lana can feel it in her bones and it is very
scared.  ``WIL test fail`` ``-7 sanity maximum``
``Discovery: fear manifest`` 

She composes herself, the woman that she is looking for is not here; 
then tries to patch her wounds, but there is no point.
``First aid check fail`` 


### Hallway 3 - Ground floor

Nothing on this hallway as she exits the previous office.

### Office 1 - Ground floor

There is a tall woman, an **Oshira Agent**, searching for something among all
the boxed scattered through this office, there is a lot of dust in the
environment, she must have been here for quite a while. She looks at Lana, then
says *'I've found this, and I have already a lot of these, so you might find it
useful.'* she handles a *Warding chalk* to Lana. She thanks the tall woman for
her consideration. ``NPC friendly``

> Great! This is my second warding chalk!

There is another person in the room, Lana hadn't realised until now due to the
thick dust floating around. ``NPC friendly`` ``NPC flavour: woman, naive,
truth, failed politician`` 

She is a woman with a confident pose, Lana thinks that surprisingly she knows
her from somewhere, but she is unable to place her. '*Yes, I ran in the London
mayoral election 15 years ago*' the woman says. '*So that was it!'* Lana
thinks. *'Take this'* the former almost-politician says *'and forget that
you've seen us here'*, she hands 41ø to Lana. *'Not enough for a bribe'* Lana
thinks, *'Maybe this is why she couldn't became mayor all those years
ago'*. ``Event: who are you?``

As she is walking around the room, she realises that there are some marks on
the floor. She moves a shelf and finds a hidden safe, but she is unable to open
it; then, suddenly a trap is triggered and a poison cloud is propelled to her
face, fortunately she is able to dodge it. ``Percetion check OK``
``Lockpicking check fail`` ``DEX test OK`` 
``Discovery: hidden stash``

The two other women in the room are looking at her and then at the safe, very
seriously, *'All yours ladies'* Lana tells them, and quickly leaves the room.

Katriin is not at this room.

She tries to patch her wounds on her way out, but she is unable. ``First aid
check fail``

### Hallway 3 / Hallway 5 - Ground floor

These hallways are empty, Lana heads to the recreation room.

### Recreation room - Ground floor

A **Golem** has been stuffed into this small recreation room, it attacks Lana
on first sight and she focuses on evading the attacks and trying to escape, she
manages to get away.

There is a pile of books in a corner near the entrance, Lana takes a closer
look and finds a *Grimoire* among classic literature books.
``Perception check OK`` ``Discovery: pile of old books``

She tries again to patch her wounds... ``First aid check fail``

Katriin is not here either.

### Hallway 5 - Ground floor

Nothing here.

### Hallway 6 - Ground floor

There are clothes and camping supplies thrown all over in this hallway, Lana is
confused, clothes make sense in a laundry, but the camping supplies are surely
something unusual. She bumps into something, she wasn't looking at where she
was going and gets injured. ``-5HP``
``INT test OK`` ``Perception check fail``

She takes some time to apply bandages on her new wounds. ``First aid check
OK!!`` ``+7HP (half)``

> \*lots of conffeti flying around\* 

Katriin is not here either.

### Hallway 7 - First floor

Lana takes the stairs to the second floor.

> **Warning!** Trigger: slight torture theme. Skip to next paragraph.

There is a man with crazy eyes, all that can be seen from his masked face,
holding a bucket full of water, he is pouring it into the head of a woman. He
is asking questions that the woman cannot answer or won't. Lana fears for the
woman's life and jumps into combat.

> **Safe after this point.**

Lana fights the man, a **Hunter**, to rescue the woman. The fight is long, but
Lana is holding on well and parries most of the attacks, the brass knuckles
that she got from the gym manager in the ground floor pack a strong punch and
the hunter curses at every punch that Lana lands. After a long fight the hunter
falls to the ground, dead.

> I thought that it would be thematic to check if this woman was Katriin (the
> target) so I decided to roll check the search goal now rather than at the end
> of the discoveries phase.

Lana releases the woman, she starts coughing, Lana asks her *'You're okay now,
what is your name?'*, *'Ka.. Katriin Mets'* she says with effort. *'I've come
to get you away from this place, hold on to me'*. ``Search OK``

> Yeah! super thematic

Lana patches her wounds. ``First aid check OK`` ``+11HP (half)``

> Karma likes Lana.

### Hallway 6 / Hallway 5 / Hallway 3 / Hallway 1 / Main Entrance - Ground floor 

Lana and Katriin exit the building safely and breath the fresh air of the
night. Katriin is still on shock, but Lana needs to speak with her. She tells
her about the Siddha order, and tries to persuade her saying that if she joins
them she would be more secure and that she would have bodyguards if she wants
to. Katriin accepts. ``Persuasion check OK``  ``+10 order points``
``Persuasion skill roll-up fail``

### Back in the Omphalos

Lana reports back to her sumbae, **Ja-Ok**, and she is very pleased with the
results. She hands Katriin over and a doctor is quickly called.

## Mission recap

* +300 favour (double) with the Siddha
* Got a magic relic: *Warding chalk*
* Got an *Alchemical treatise* and a *Grimoire* 
* Mission reward: 500ø
* Loot (half price ``Appraisal check fail``): 1200ø


I really like how thematic it went, this was a very satisfying run!
