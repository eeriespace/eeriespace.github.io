## Tuesday, new moon - Day 2 at the Omphalos

Today is a very busy day at the Omphalos, there are people walking in a hectic
pace and representatives from all the Orders that Lana knows of are talking in
groups. ``Daily event: representatives Meeting``

Lana is in a cafe talking to **Cecil Lyons**, the representative from the Causa
Cientiae order that gave her yesterday's mission. **Keith Head**, a friend of
Cecil's and also from the order, has joined and starts commenting what Lana
should and what she shouldn't have done in yesterday's mission. He pisses Lana
off, but she doesn't comment anything. ``Random encounter: taking offence``

Lana heads to the Order's Hall, the representatives from the Mesu-Betesh are
also in the hall, and since Lana has been told that they rarely appear at the
Omphalos (something related to that they dislike being organised), she
approaches a man with smokey eyes and asks whether the order has any mission
available.

The man wants her to recover an ancient Egyptian amulet from an artefact
shipment that has just arrived to the British Museum. Lana accepts the mission
and she is given a keycard of an employee working in the restoration department
that she must use to enter to the museum. ``Mission: recover`` ``Search target:
16``

## Generating the location

The mission takes place in a ``Museum`` (the British Museum), and has the
following locations:

* A - Entry hall
* B - Lobby
* C - Administrative Office
* D - Exhibit hall x 10
* E - Hallway x 8
* F - Security office
* G - Archive

Coincidentally, I had previously rolled a Museum site with the same
characteristics (it is where my previous character died), so I will re-purpose
the map:

<p align="center"><small>The British Museum, Egyptian area</small></p>

## The mission

Lana accesses the museum using the employee's keycard and heads to the
visitor's entrance to begin her search. 

### Entry hall - Ground floor

There are no enemies on sight.
She sees some ancient script that she is unable to understand. ``Linguistics
check``

She heads to the adjacent administrative office.

## Administrative office #1 - Ground floor

A **Guard** on watch angrily shouts at Lana, she prepares for combat. Lana is
faster and makes the first shot, dealing a considerable amount of damage, the
guard is stunned for one round. She fails her next shot. The guard recovers his
movement. Lana deals more damage, but she is also heavily injured, the guard 
asks for help using his walkie-talkie, but no one comes. Lana shots a couple
more rounds, the guard shots back and finally dies.

She loots the corpse equipping the *Light Kevlar* armour, and safely stores the
Beretta 92, a baton and a pair of gold earrings in her rucksack.

Suddenly a memory from a past life assaults her, she falls on her knees and
stays paralysed for a couple of minutes, then she is able to keep her composure
and stands up. ``WILL check``
> It is very thematic to have rolled this event in this exact location, this is
where my previous character died!

She finds some notes about spiritual entities, but she fails to make any sense
of them. ``Occult knowledge check``

Lana tries to patch up her woulds using *Bandages*, but the wounds are too
deep, she remembers that she has another option, and uses the *Salamander's
Gift* that she got yesterday to fully heal her injuries.

> I totally forgot about the *Salamander's Gift*.

Fully healed, she walks to the lobby.

## Lobby - Ground floor

Another **Guard** is doing her round, she looks towards Lana angrily, and Lana
shows her the keycard that she got from the Mesu-Betesh adept, "I work here"
Lana says. "The museum is closed for civilian employees at this hour" the guard
replies, then draws her weapon. ``Enemy NPC reaction: unfriendly`` ``Persuasion
check``

Lana scores a couple of critical hits and stuns the guard, she doesn't call for
help and dies after a couple of deadly exchanges. Lana takes her weapons,
armour and finds a ring on her pocket.

The door to the Security office is closed, and Lana can't open it. She takes a
breath and uses some *Bandages* to heal her wounds from the last
combat. ``First aid check``

## Hallway #1 - Ground floor

A very amicable **Guard** greets Lana and gives her an *Alchemical Treaty*, it
seems that he has mistaken her for someone else. ``Enemy NPC reaction:
friendly`` 

> YES!! YES!!

## Hallway #5 - Floor -1

Lana goes down the stairs to the hallway that leads to the Archive, and she
meets another **Guard**. He sees the *Alchemical Treaty* in her hands and since
that hallway leads to the Archive, it seems plausible. This guard is also very
friendly and gives Lana another *Alchemical Treaty*. ``Enemy NPC reaction:
friendly``

> OMG. I swear to the DnD god that I got another 10 in the NPC reactions
> table and a 4 in the valuables.

Lana uses another *Bandage* to heal her wounds.

## Archive - Floor -1

The archive is full of holds with parchments and old books. There are some
objects that no one is going to miss in this mess, so Lana takes them, they
could be possibly sold by 100ø at the Omphalos. ``Appraisal check``

## Back at Hallway #1 - Ground floor

Going back to the first floor, Lana stumbles upon another **Guard**, but he is
not the friendly guard that she met before. Moreover as he tries to attack her,
Lana manages to escape, but the attack lands. ``Skill: retreat``

## Administrative Office #2 - Ground floor

Lana opens the door to the administrative office that is to her left and
another **Guard** greets her. This guard is also friendly and asks her to buy
him something from the vending machines near the entrance and gives her
44ø. "Bring me a Coke, diet, please." ``Enemy NPC reaction: friendly`` 

## Exhibit hall #5 - Ground floor

Lana enters to the first exhibit hall, there are lots of pots in different
preservation statuses, she keeps walking between the stands when a barrier
blocks her way and causes her some stomach ache and nausea. Lana collects
herself and ignores the way she's feeling. ``WILL check``


## Exhibit hall #4 - Ground floor

These exhibit stands are all about papyrus parchments, and looking at them
there is **a muscular lad** very obviously smelling like pot, and with a lot of
Egyptian religious paraphernalia. He turns to Lana and tells her that he is
Horus' messenger. Lana quickly replies that she is Isis' incarnation, so she
commands the messenger of his son to get lost. Impressed, the muscular lad gets
out of her way. ``Enemy NPC reaction: unfriendly`` ``Persuasion check``

> Horus is Isis' child, I learned this from a book that I bought at the British
> Museum[^1].

Lana starts searching for the mysterious amulet at this point.

## Exhibit hall #3 - Ground floor

This area is bigger enough to hold a couple of statues and obelisks. There is
another **Guard** doing her rounds. She is also very friendly and gives Lana a
*Grimoire*. ``Enemy NPC reaction: friendly``

> Today is my day

Between the statues there are piles of books, but Lana doesn't see anything of
value, the amulet doesn't seem to be in this hall either. ``Perception check``

## Exhibit hall #2 - Ground floor

This exhibit hall has also a **Guard** which attacks Lana without thinking it
twice. Lana manages to sneak in a sarcophagus and the guard loses her. ``Sneak
check``

This exposition has a lot of ancient books and papyrus, between them, on a
counter Lana finds a *Grimoire*. ``Perception check``

> This is my very first successful perception check!

Moreover, in a nearby display cabinet, **an amulet** that matches the
description of the objective is displayed; Lana takes it and heads back to the
museum's entrance.

She manages to get out without any further encounters!

## Mission recap

Lana was extremely lucky today, and for some reason the Guards were very
friendly.

* Two dead guards: +10 chaos points and -10 favour
* +140 favour with the Mesu-Betesh order
* 500ø
* Got Alchemical Treaty x2, Grimoire x2
* Random objects to sell for 100ø
* 44ø from the guard that wanted a Diet Coke
* One light kevlar armour to sell, two Berettas and two batons from the dead
  guards
