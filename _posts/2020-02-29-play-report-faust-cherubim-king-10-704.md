This play report is the first session of my
[Mothership RPG](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/mothership) solo campaign,
where I build the space station that will serve as a base for the characters.

The campaign started more than a year ago, so I might have forgotten how I made
some things, but I have the majority of them documented. 
I will continue posting the story so far and let's see if we can catch up with
where my characters currently are.

## Worldbuilding a space station

<p align="center"><small>Or Faust-C, as the locals say</small></p>

When I played this session Mothership's [A Pound of
Flesh](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/a-pound-of-flesh) module wasn't even
kickstarted yet, so I couldn't use its magnificent space station generator, but
I had [Hulks &
Horrors](http://www.bedroomwallpress.com/p/hulks-and-horrors.html) on me an the
[Dead Planet](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/dead-planet) module. So I
managed to hack something up.

* **How does it look like?**

    I rolled 12d6 to make the station's layout, using the idea of the **Derelict
    Ship mapping** from Dead Planet. Then, since I wasn't making a ship I used
    Hulks & Horror's **Pod Colony Rooms Table** to know what each sector was.

    Why didn't you use H&H's actual space station generator and that's it?
    Well, because it had a very micro-view and I was looking for the
    macro. Each die in the station layout is going to be massive sector, and I
    was looking for the main point of interest of that sector, at this point of
    the solo-play campaign it doesn't make any sense to me to fill all the
    details. The Pod Colony Rooms table just gave me the small brush-stroke
    that I wanted.

    So I roll 1d12 for each die and I got:
    
    * Weapon's locker: this makes no sense, so it would be the overall station
      security sector, where station security barracks and training facilities
      are.
    * Engineering: internal systems, so these people are in charge of fixing
      everything that happens inside the space station (see below for the
    other engineering).
    * Galley: this makes no sense, so in the space station this would be the
      restaurants area and where the food processing facilities are.
    * Containment: prison (the Freezer), this gave me an idea with is developed
      below. There might be also research areas where some kind of containment
      is needed.
    * Market square: where you buy stuff, from food to weapons, drugs, ships,
      clothes, maps, the water recycler for your room etc.
    * Quarters: massive residential blocks.
    * Control room: where the life support systems, artificial gravity,
      telecommunications and all the systems that control the space station
      are.
    * Entertainment: entertainment district, bars, virtual reality
      asteroid-golf experiences...
    * Storage: maybe you can rent storage rooms with different mÂ³ and store
      *anything* here, no questions asked, but it is very expensive.
    * Shuttle bay: docks and dry docks, anything related to ships.
    * Entertainment: another entertainment district, this one with more shady
      businesses.
    * Engineering: external systems, these ones do space-walking and
      sometimes support the engineers from the docks.

* **How is it?**

    Using Augmented Reality's **Expanded building features**: *High tech
    equipment*, *Self sufficient* and *Well guarded*.

* **What is the purpose of the station?**
    
    Using Augmented Reality's **The games corporates Play** and **Ways and
    means**: *Target undesirables* and *Mercenary Contractors*.
  
*  **Who runs it?**

    Using Augmented Reality's **Corporate aristocrats** table I got: *Adam
    Hamilton, once a spy for an ecoterrorist commune.*

* **How is it named?**

    Using Dead Planet's 3d10 **Ship Name Generator**: Faust Cherubim King
    10-707
    
    The numbers at the end of the name were my rolls: 10-7-4 and I added some
    zeroes there because it looked cooler that way.

## Putting it all together

Year 4072, the humanity has broken the terrestrial atmosphere's barrier and has
established in all the corners of space. One of these settlements is the
FAUST CHERUBIM KING 10-704 space station, commanded by **Adam Hamilton**,
which at the beginning of the year 4000 made a living by spying for the
ecoterrorist communes.
> I didn't want to fill any more details about this NPC right now.

**Faust-C**, as it's commonly known, is the source of both envy and admiration
of many other space stations that conduct dishonest businesses. The whole space
station is out in the open about it and it is its main source of income, in
contrast to other places where it is known that a shady underworld exists, and
you can definitely hire mercenaries and buy extremely dangerous and illegal
merchandise, but you have to do it with caution and pay extra credit to the
information brokers to set you up with the right people.

Faust-C was able to rise as the place to go for hiring mercenaries, buying
merchandise and installing illegal military mods due to the high level contacts
that Hamilton made during the years, which at the end of the day, happened to
had a problem that *needed fixing*. The station is heavily guarded by military
subcontractors and as any other station, is self sufficient.

The economy of the station does not differ from any other, in fact, due to the
black businesses being welcomed, it is thriving. Apart from the assassination,
kidnapping, thieving and other high rate services that many unions offer, the
station needs haulers to mine nearby asteroids for resources and depends on
trading with other outposts to get many other things. So, normal jobs as
security guards, engineers, noodle shop stall managers, janitors and space
traffic controllers also exist.

Among the streets of the station a controlled chaos reigns governed by the
constant threat that **the Freezer** exerts. Faust-C has a whole sector
dedicated to this massive prison-shop, where people that piss off others so
much and become a problem to the station's stability itself are
*stored*. Depending on the "crime" you can expect to wake up from the
cryosleep pods in a couple of months, years, or not wake up at all. Moreover if
you're lucky to wake up, don't expect to be the same, since, well, you become
merchandise and the station can make good credit selling your lungs to a now
retired gas giant miner.
