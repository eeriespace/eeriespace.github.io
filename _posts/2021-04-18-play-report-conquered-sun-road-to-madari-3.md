## Intro

**Previously, on [part
2 of *Road to
Madari*...]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/03/27/play-report-conquered-sun-road-to-madari-2/)**
Thythe finally reaches the location where the mission will take place. There
she meets a child and a woman that help her. They have been hunted 
by the hunter for years. The woman and Thythe work together to kill the hunter
and no one is badly hurt.

**· HEX O19, Akkar Strand** 

> I've realised that I've been writting Akkar*d* Strand instead of Akkar
> Strand, so I've fixed all the typos haha

``Do they want to join Thythe on her way back to Clear
Wood?`` ``Almost certain`` The woman looks at Thythe after they finish
distributing the hunter's old belongings, *'Now that the danger is over let me
introduce ourselves. I'm **she-Kunta** and this is my little brother
**he-Raexa**'*. Thythe introduces herself as well.

**Kunta** tells her that now that they're free from their persecutor, they
would like to live in a more secure location, and that the settlement that she
had mentioned before could be a great option. So, they ask Thythe if they could
accompany her. Thythe agrees.

They spend the day resting to recover from their wounds. ``+5HP, -1 ration``
``Twist: 2 -> 2``

> Kunta and Raexa also consume rations, Kunta has 13 rations at this point
> (after they both consume one each).

**· HEX N20, A.S.** Thythe heads south-east, she wants to avoid the ruins that
she encounter on her way to the caves. This route is a success and they don't
find any more ruins on their way, they can travel at a good pace.

``+2XP hex`` ``-1 ration`` ``Twist: 2 -> 2``

**· HEX M19, A.S.**  The group is now travelling through an area that Thythe
knows from before, and they don't encounter any enemies. ``-1 ration`` ``Twist:
2 -> 2``

**· HEX L18, A.S.** They travel through some bare land with the same huge tree
that Thythe discovered before. ``-1 ration`` ``Twist: 2 -> 2``

**· HEX K19, A.S.** More black sand and low hills in another travel day without
incidents.  ``-1 ration`` ``Twist: 2 -> 2``

**· HEX J18, A.S.** The group passes through the burned remains of a
caravan. Thythe tells **Kunta** about how she found it on her way to the caves
and about the spiders that were everywhere. ``Have they seen anything like this 
before? Almost certain but, `` ``New character, discovery, community`` 

**Kunta** tells her that she has seen these type of occurrences before, and as she
is starting to explain more about it, people covered in ashes come out of the
ground. Their lances aggressively point to the group. ``NPC attitude: neutral,
willing to trade items/info``

These people do not attack Thythe and the rest of the group, but they remain
vigilant. An old farmer, unarmed, comes closer, she makes a gesture to the rest
of her people and they lower their lances. *'I'm looking for information
regarding these spiders, and whatever happened here,'* she demands. Thythe
walks towards her and tells her about her first time in this area, when she was
just passing through to get to another location, and that this is their second
time here, they are headed to the **Clear Wood** settlement in the west. They
weren't here when whatever happened happened. ``Does she believe her? Yes`` The
farmer nods. *'Has anything out of the ordinary happen on your travels around
these areas?'*, she asks Thythe. She tells the farmer about the unusual
creature guarding a cave to the west, it was unusual since these type of
creatures in her experience do not stay in a single point and guard it, they
like to hunt. ``Is this info interesting? Very unlikely, but..`` ``Something
the PCs think to be one way is actually another``

> I think that we cannot know about what we are wrong about just yet. So I'll
> leave it as it is for now.

The farmer seems uninterested about this information. ``Do they let them go?
Likely, and a new character appears`` ``Transform, faction`` The woman nods her
head as a farewell, and a young man comes closer to Thythe's group. *'I will
accompany you to the cave, the elder is not interested in what you have told
her, but she isn't the only one in charge. My name is **Ardren**'*, he says, and by
the tone of his voice Thythe knows that he won't take a no for an answer. So
Thythe welcomes him to the group, the more they're the safer they can travel.

``Twist: 2->1`` ``-1 ration``

**· HEX I19, A.S.** Thythe remains akert while they travel west headed to the
Clear Wood settlement, but no enemies are on sight. **Ardren** mostly ignores
the group. ``Twist: 1->1`` ``-1 ration``

**· HEX H20, A.S.** Thythe notices a group of enemies in the distance, they are
a couple of **Sprawlings of the Vhol'est**, they are creatures related to the
**Spawn of Vhol'Est** that she fought in the **Hidden Cave**, but less
dangerous. She tells the group that she will handle these alone.

She takes her bow and kill one before the group is able to come closer, but
they're actually more than a couple, three Sprawlings are in melee
range. Thythe changes her long bow for a sword and handles the rest of the
enemies. She is unable to parry a couple of attacks, but she slays them without
much problems. ``+5XP vermin`` ``+2XP hex`` ``First aid OK: +3HP`` 
``Twist 1->2`` ``-1 ration``

**· HEX G19, A.S.** The group continues their journey. **Kunta** is a but
worried since she only has one ration left for her and her brother, but Thythe
agrees to share her rations and they will pay her back once they reach the
settlement. ``-2 rations`` ``Twist: 2->2``

**· HEX F18, A.S. Hidden Cave.** They arrive at the cave, nothing out
of the ordinary stands out. **Ardren** locates the entrance ``Does he want
help? Very unlikely`` and heads in straight away without saying anything.

The rest of the group ignores him and rest for the remaining of the day.

``-3 rations`` ``Twist: 2->2``

**· HEX E19, A.S. Clear Wood.** They finally arrive at the settlement. **Raexa**
goes away to investigate this new place while **Kenta** accompanies Thythe to
find her patrons. They finally find the townspeople that told her about their
enemy and Thythe shows the armour of the deceased hunter as proof of
death. ``+150XP, +500 jats``

> And we level up! I now have 4EP to spend.

**Raexa** comes with the three rations that they owe Thythe and they decide
that they will remain in this settlement for a while, they are looking for
people to work and help them rebuild and reconstruct what was destroyed by the
flood. 

Thythe tries to find an armour-smith that might be able to adapt the Light
Armour that she got from the hunter. She finds one and tasks her with adapting
the armour to her build. It will be done in a couple of days. ``-200 jats`` She
also sells the **Shalvan Wood Weapon** that she got as loot a while back after
defeating the **Spawn of Vhol’Est** in the beginning of her journey. ``+1500
jats``

She rests for the remaining of the day and puts her thoughts in order. She
highly doubts that **Ardren** could be OK on his own after so many creatures of
the *Vhol'est* kind have appeared recently, and she also has her doubts about
his motivations and whatever the elder (the farmer) from Ardren's group didn't
tell her. She decides that she will investigate the Hidden Cave once her armour
is done.

## Recap

**tldr:** On their journey to Clear Wood they bump into some people that demand
info about the spiders and the remains of the caravan, one of these people
(Ardren) decides to go to the Hidden Cave with them. Thythe, Kenta and Raexa
arrive at the Clear Wood settlement. Thythe levels up after telling her success
in the assassination mission to her patrons.

**Campaign goal:** Get to Madari and live a more comfortable life there.

**Current mission:** heal and wait until the Light Armour is done.
