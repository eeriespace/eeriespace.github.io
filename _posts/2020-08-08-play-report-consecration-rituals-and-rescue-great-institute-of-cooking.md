## Thursday, full moon - Day 18 at the Omphalos

There is a vibrant and overpowering atmosphere arriving at the Omphalos that
infuses everyone with fresh power. ``+100VP free to use`` ``Event: tapping a key line``

> This could be an interesting event to have in the future, now I can't use
> those extra *vril* points for anything...

Lana comes across **Paek Ja-Ok**, the representative from the **Siddha** that
gave her her last mission, she is sitting with some workmates and invites Lana
to join them. The rest of the group is not as welcoming as her sumbae, but Lana
is accustomed to being picked on and manages to put them down. They apologise
and lend her their order's ritual chamber for the day.  ``INT test OK``
``Encounter: taking offence``

Lana goes into the Siddha's ritual chamber to try a **tool consecration
ritual**... aaaaaaand fails. ``Magic Liturgy check fail`` 

``Skill roll-up check: OK``

> Well, that's is something positive for the day!

## Friday, third quarter - Day 19 at the Omphalos

To Lana's surprise **Keith**, **Cecil**'s friend from the Causa Scientiae order,
whom Lana cannot stand is at the Omphalos' entrance waiting for her.

He warns her: *'There are undercover agents from the Covenant of the Glorious
Dawn after you'* (these are some of Lana's antagonists) *'you should go home
and stay put for the rest of the day while we handle this'*. Lana thanks him,
still surprised by his attitude, and goes back home.

## Saturday, third quarter - Day 20 at the Omphalos

Everything is on sale today! ``Event: lower prices``

Lana decides to take advantage of the sale and stocks some *bandages* and
*frankincense*, she consumes a lot of those.

As she is heading to the Hall of the Orders, a man approaches her, he wants to
buy her *athame* (a ceremonial blade used in rituals), he will be giving her
double the market normal price, he is in a hurry and needs to use it in a
ritual. Lana tells him that she hasn't consecrated the *athame* yet. The man
looks at her with dead eyes and leaves muttering *'Kids these
days... good-for-nothing'* ``Encounter: A man in need``

There isn't any order present, Lana is a bit disappointed but understands that
maybe everyone is just trying to make the most of the sales and they'll be busy
shopping for the rest of the day.  ``Orders present: none``

She heads to the ritual chamber, pays the fee and tries a **tool consecration
ritual**... aaaaaand fails. ``Magic Liturgy check fail``

## Sunday, new moon - Day 21 at the Omphalos

So, Lana hears that some orders seem to be angry at each other and there isn't
any representative from any of them working today. ``Event: order dispute``

Since the news of the orders being out of service today was very sudden, there
are still a lot of people coming to the Omphalos, one of those people is a
celebrity from an eccentric order. Lana approaches them, but they give her the
cold shoulder. ``CHA test fail`` ``Encounter: celebrity``

She goes to the ritual chamber again, pays the fee tries a **tool consecration
ritual**... aaaand fails. ``Magic Liturgy check fail``

## Monday, new moon - Day 22 at the Omphalos

The dispute from yesterday is still going on. ``Event: order dispute``

Some people of the Kadmonites try to pick a fight with Lana and she cannot do
anything when they bad-mouth her. ``Encounter: taking offence``
``INT test fail`` 

She goes to the ritual chamber to try another **tool consecration
ritual**... and succeeds! Lana is able to finally consecrate the **athame**,
she will use this in an invocation ritual, but she still needs to consecrate
four more tools. ``Magic Liturgy check OK``

> Have you seen that? YES!!!! I rolled a 7 and my Magic Liturgy skill is
> at 13. 

## Tuesday, first quarter - Day 23 at the Omphalos

The lower prices have come back! ``Event: lower prices``

The orders are officially in good terms with each other again, but some adepts
haven't made peace with each other yet; a fight starts in a bar and Lana is
unable to avoid it, she ends up with a broken nose. ``Encounter: fight``
``-14HP``

She walks towards the Hall of the Orders, her friend **Cecil** from the **Causa
Scientiae** order is the only representative that is working today *'Those
sales are devastating'*, Lana thinks.

Cecil has a mission for her, since she did well in a previous rescue operation
they have another one for her. They are looking for a Sudanese man, **Obungo
Ochuka**, that is currently being held against his will in a nearby museum, the
**Great Institute of Cooking**.

``Mission: kidnap`` ``Search 16``

## At the Great Institute of Cooking

### Entry Hall

There is a elderly woman sitting on a chair passed the entrance, she sees her
and says: *'I didn't know that the museum was taking visitors, we are
undergoing renovations, but well you know.. times are tough and we need to
make a living'* she approaches her and gives Lana 52ø, *'go rescue my friend'*
she says, then leaves. ``Event: who are you?``

> hahaha that's not a fair price for a rescue!

### Lobby

A **Golem** is slowly guarding the Lobby, a big and tall construct that has
flat feett.

> I will always imagine golems as they were depicted in the [Dragon Quest
> videogames](https://dragonquest.fandom.com/wiki/Golem).


It attacks Lana. Her objective is to get away from this dangerous
thing, and it takes her a couple of turns but she manages to get away
unscratched.

Lana triggers some alarm while she is fleeing from the golem and two
**Curators** come to greet her. Lana flees after taking a couple of
hits. ``Event: tripped alarm`` ``Technology check fail``

> My Technology skill is at 0, Lana is less than a script kiddie.

There is a strange ancient mural hanging on a wall, it stands out in this
modern museum, Lana almost falls into a slumber and gets
distracted. ``Discovery: ancient mural`` ``INT test fail``
``Next initiative in combat lost`` 

Lana composes herself and takes a couple of bandages, but they do
nothing. ``First aid check fail``

> Here we go again.

### Hallway 1

There is nothing of interest nor dangerous here. Lana spends some time trying
to patch her wounds, but she can't. ``First aid check fail``

### Administrative Office 1

There are strange sigils and symbols drawn everywhere, Lana tries to make sense
of them, but she is unable. ``-7 sanity`` ``Discovery: ritual area`` ``Magical
liturgy check fail``

### Hallway 1

Lana exits the administrative office to go to the office next door, and a
**Daeva**, a human possessed by a demon, gets in her way.

Lana decides to fight the Daeva, it casts *Vril choke* on Lana a couple of
times but she manages to defeat it. She searches the corpse, it has a tiny
glass flask filled with sand...

### Administrative Office 2

A **Guard** is doing some paperwork on his desk, he is unfriendly and starts
questioning Lana. She comes up with a risky reply *'Don't you know me? I'm in
charge of renovating this museum.'* Lana uses the info that the woman told her
in the entrance *'I'm checking the layout of the museum, mmmm we'll need to
re-arrange these offices...'* The guard excuses himself and continues with the
paperwork. ``NPC reaction: suspicious`` ``Persuasion check OK``

There are some random items that Lana might me able to sell at the Omphalos,
she thinks that they would give her 50ø, give or take, she takes them with
her. ``Appraisal check fail`` ``Discovery: random items``

She takes some time to try to patch her wounds, but she is unable. ``First aid
check fail``

### Hallway 1

Back in this hallway she comes across a **Vessel**, he smiles and gives her a
book: *'Go read this one, it is fantastic'*, then leaves. ``Got Alchemical
treatise``

> Great!

### Lobby

There isn't anything here.

### Hallway 2

A **Curator** blocks her path. He scores a lot of hits before Lana can get
away, she is gravely injured at this point. She decides to give up on the
rescue mission.

### Lobby & Entrance

No enemies going back to the exit.

> Thank you Random God!

## Mission recap

* Random items: 50ø
* Lost 7 sanity
* Got an Alchemical Treatise
* -50 favour with Causa Scientiate

I should try to make the map layout more beneficial and avoid having to walk
through already explored areas, but sometimes I want to draw something
quick. Nevertheless, this time I got a lot of combat encounters and started the
mission with a broken nose (-14HP).

Well, Lana is still alive!
