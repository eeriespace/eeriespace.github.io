In one of [my past play
reports]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/03/11/play-report-the-poison-research-lab/) of
Seekers Beyond the Shroud I encountered a Yōkai foe, but I thought that it was
generic and that I could extend it adding more yōkai, that resulted in a
**Yōkai Bestiary for Seekers Beyond the Shroud**.

Every time you get an encounter with a yōkai in Seekers, you simply roll on the
yōkai table of the bestiary and get a yōkai type, or depending on the location
that you are, you can roll for a more thematic yōkai per location.

It still needs to be playtested.
