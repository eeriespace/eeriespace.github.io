Play report of the third session of *Lana Vanne's ascension to the occult*
campaign using [Seekers Beyond The
Shroud](https://blackoathgames.com/seekers-beyond-the-shroud).

You may want to read the 
[first]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/25/play-report-burning-spices/) and
[second]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/27/play-report-the-egyptian-amulet/) parts of
the campaign. 

## Wednesday, first quarter - Doing some research

Lana spends some time studying one of the *grimoires* that she obtained during
the last mission.

> I roll for an entity on the 1-39 range, I am looking to get something
> plausible for my first spirit, otherwise is going to be very difficult and
> I'm eager to learn some magic. So, I get **Taavi**, which has Rank 10 (lower
> easier), so it's great.

Lana makes a list of the different rituals and materials that she will need to
summon the spirit:
* Best day and moon phase: Sunday, New Moon
* Aligment: Order. (This is bad for Lana since she is currently at Chaos 10, so
  if she were to use the  Sternian way of summoning, aka passing a *Persuasion*
  check, she would need to roll under 35: base persuasion 50, -10 from the
  spirit rank, -5 from the Chaos; so maybe she would need to use the Solomonic
  way of summoning, aka automatic succeed, but only granting partial bonuses)
* Ritual: *Basic Summoning Ritual*
  * Choose between the Solomonic (aka automatic) or Sternian (aka pass
    persuasion check) ways
  * Magic liturgy check
  * 80VP
  * Candles (free)
  * Frankincense: 100ø (consumed after 1 use)
  * Consecrated robes (see below)
  * Athame: 100ø (since this is a tool, it lasts many rituals)
  * Chalice: 100ø (same as above)
  * Wand: 100ø (same as above)
  * Pentacle: 100ø (same as above)
* Ritual Robes: 200ø
* Tool and robe consecration: *Tool Consecration ritual*
  * 50VP per item (x5): total 250VP (ritual robes, athame, chalice, wand and
    pentacle)
  * Candles (free)
  * Frankincense: 100ø (x5): total 500ø
  * Magic liturgy check
* Rent a ritual chamber for the day: 100ø x5 days at least

## Day 3 at the Omphalos

Lana heads to the Omphalos to do some shopping, she needs to buy some materials
to start performing rituals, and to eventually invoke **Taavi**. Upon arrival a
festive atmosphere welcomes her, apparently it is the day of King Solomon and
all the stores (but not the bars) are closed. ``Daily event: store closed``

> \*sigh\* No shopping today...

Resigned, she starts walking to the Order's Hall where she meets **Merle
Morton**, a renowned spiritist specialised in the fire element and those
entities that have a liking to it. Since the vestige that Lana wants to invoke
has also something to do with fire, and because she has done her homework, she
is able to keep a conversation with the expert and he is impressed. They
exchange phone numbers. ``CHA check`` 

Then Lana greets Cecil, apparently the Causa Cientiae order is the only one
whose members aren't all drinking on a bar.
``Orders present: Causa Cientiae``

Without having to ask, Cecil starts talking shop, maybe she is also eager to
end her shift and join the festivities, and explains to Lana what is the new
mission that the order is requesting. They are looking for a woman that has
been kidnapped. ``Mission: rescue`` ``Search: 16``

> I roll for two hints on my **Locations in a City - Business table** of The
> Tome of Adventure Design to know more about the location and I get:
> **assassin or poisoner** and **guildhall**.

The building is an abandoned poison research lab of a rival sect and the woman
is a famous alchemy researcher that specialises in poisons. Apparently the sect
wants her to cook some poisons using their old facilities, and the Causa
Cientiae order wants her free, but they would also be very pleased if she were
to join their ranks.

Lana accepts the mission.

## Generating the location

Let's create that abandoned research lab, based on an ``Abandoned complex``
site: 

* A - Main entrance
* B - Hallway x 15
* C - Warehouse
* D - Office/Room x18 (these are a lot, so I only draw about 15 on the map)
* ~~E - Recreation room~~
* F - Parking lot

## The abandoned poison research lab

### Main entrance - Ground floor

Lana enters the old building and it is greeted by a **Failed chimera**.
> Oh my... Why??? 

She stands frozen for half a second, she is surprised to see again one of these
horrible creatures that almost killed her a [couple of days
ago]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/25/play-report-burning-spices/), but somehow
manages to compose herself and shots a bullet from her pistol, which strikes.
The chimera reaches her and rips her *Light kevlar armour*, she has to take it
off in a hurry because the chimera's saliva is corrosive and renders the armour
useless and dangerous to whom it is wearing it. Lana tries to escape in vain.

The chimera then attacks again and Lana is yet unable to elude its claws, the
pain paralyses her.

Another attack, this time one that Lana can elude; using the momentum she tries
to escape again, but it is futile. The chimera is quicker.

Yet another attack, Lana's left arm almost gets ripped of her body, the wound
is very deep, flesh is teared and she can see her own bones. Fear and pain
paralyses her again.
> The freaking chimera rolled a 10 on damage, d10 + 20 points total.

The chimera tries to leap on Lana again, but she manages to dodge, blood
dripping on the floor.

Using the momentum from the dodge, Lana tries to escape again, but the chimera
stands in her way, and tries to finish her of, fortunately Lana is able to
dodge.

Lana continues to be faster and gathers all the strength that she has left to
escape using a blind spot that the chimera has left open after its last attack
to escape from this deadly creature.
> Hell yeah. I rolled a 20 on initiative and a 19 over the Chimera's DEX of 17
to escape.

Then she hears a group of voices... well, growls getting closer to her location,
her face turns white just by imagining that they could be more of those
chimeras. The things hear her, and Lana quickly decides to throw the flashlight
that she got from one of the British Museum guards during [yesterday's
mission]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/02/27/play-report-the-egyptian-amulet/) the
opposite way, and the sounds go in that direction.

Now in relative safety, she tries to patch her wounds, but the bandages are
useless.

### Hallway 1 - Ground floor

She still tries to go through with the mission, her pride refusing her to quit
after just entering the lab.

There is nothing interesting in this hallway. Lana tries again to patch her
wounds, but she is unsuccessful.

### Room 1 - Ground floor

Nothing of interest again, Lana tries again to apply some bandages to her
wounds, but she is very clumsy and fails.

> My *first aid* skill is at 32 (42 if I use bandages) if you were wondering.

### Hallway 2 - Ground floor

The trend persists, nothing of interest and Lana cannot heal herself.

### Room 2  - Ground floor

A possessed person, an entity known as a **Bhuta** rushes towards Lana, but is
too slow, she can shot at it as it approaches and later on slash the Bhuta with
her knife, but luck is not on her side, and misses it for a cm.

Lana has another chance to attack, but she fails again, the bhuta does the same
and the attack is identically dodged.

The tiredness begins to kick in and the Bhuta scores a hit on Lana, but she
manages to get a hold of her strength and attacks the creature, the knife rips
the creature's skin, then although no longer human, the creature's body gets
paralysed because of the trauma.

Lana uses her advantage over the paralysed creature to kill it.

Looking around the room, Lana's attention focuses on some marks on the ground,
some chunky stuff was dragged to the nearby shelve. Looking closer there is a
secret panel hiding a strongbox. Lana uses her lock-picks to try to open it up,
but fails. ``Perception, Lockpicking``

Lana tries again to heal her wounds and succeeds.

> Hooray!

### Hallway 3 - Ground floor

An old man of dangerous looks, covered in tattoos of the names of the entities
that he has melded with crosses Lana's path. Upon closer inspection, Lana is
sure, this man is an **Ancient**, and it is as dangerous as it looks. The man
changes to a battling pose. ``NPC reaction: hostile``

Well, even if he is dangerous, he is still an old man and Lana is quicker, so
she manages to sneak out of the battle.

She manages to patch up her wounds a little more and takes the stairs down.

### Hallway 4 - Floor -1

An **Adept** with an symbol on her jacket that Lana cannot recognise greets her
with a grin and draws her dagger. ``Occult knowledge`` ``NPC reaction:
hostile``

Lana attacks her with her knife without losing any second and avoids the
adept's dagger, then she scores a very well put swing and the adept falls to
the ground, paralysed by the pain.

> I rolled a 1, this is my first time ever.
> (While I was writing this post I realised that a 1 is a failure instead of a
> critical success)

Lana then uses her advantage to score another critical hit and the adept dies.

> Then I rolled a 2, if this keeps going I would even take a failed chimera
> without breaking a sweat.

Lana loots the corpse, taking its *dagger*, a *P226 pistol* and a *Healing
Concoction*. Then she looks for anything on her pockets and sees a BDSM ball
gag, she wonders why the hell would someone carry that out of their bedrooms 
and drinks the *Healing Concoction*.

### Parking loot - Floor -1

It doesn't seem to be anything of interest there at first, but then she hears
some noises coming out of one of the cars. She breaks the window of the car
with her elbow and sees a blindfolded and handcuffed woman. After releasing
her, the woman tells her that she is **Kaira Duran**, a Cameroonian alchemy
researcher. ``NPC traits: drifter, fame, fragile``

Lana has successfully located the hostage, but now they both have to escape to
safety.

### Hallway 4 - Floor -1

Going back to the hallway where the stairs are a **Hunter** crosses their path
and draws his knife. ``NPC reaction: hostile``

The hunter is quick and swings his knife towards Lana, but she manages to avoid
it. Then both she and Kaira escape from the hunter using the stairs.

### Hallway 3 - Ground floor

A **Yōkai** appears next to the pillars that support the stairs, it seems to be
a *Sakabashira*. It attacks first but Lana is able to dodge its attack and
attempts to escape. The escape is unsuccessful, but in the next turn Lana tries
again and succeeds, the two women leave the yokai behind.

### Room 2 - Ground floor

Nothing appears on this room.

### Hallway 2 - Ground floor

After going through the room with the strongbox the women arrive to the long
hallway that makes a turn to the entrance. A **Orisha agent** crosses their
path, but they keep their cool and continue walking. ``NPC reaction: ignore`` 

### Hallway 1 - Ground floor

A **Guard dog** appears. Lana manages to shoot at it before it jumps on her,
then dodges it to quickly stab it with her knife. The dog falls to the
ground, stands, and comes back, but then again, Lana manages to dodge it
safely. Lana stabs the poor animal again and it dies.

Lana uses more of her bandages to heal her wounds.

### Entrance - Ground Floor

Another **Sect Adept** from an organisation that Lana cannot recognise crosses
the women's path. ``Occult Knowledge`` ``NPC reaction: hostile``

Lana misses her fist shot, and the man attacks her with a sword, she is left
paralysed by the pain. The adept strikes again. Lana is hurt. Then it strikes
again, and again; the situation is dire. But this time Lana moves first and she
and Kaira run away.

> I hope that Lana can defeat one of these guys one day to get one of those
> swords. 

### Out of the building

Lana and Kaira are now safe and sound out of the building and in a nearby
street. Lana can now calmly speak with Kaira, and she asks her whether she
would be willing to join the Causa Cientiae Order.

Kaira answers that she is not interested in joining an order with people as
weak as her; Lana answers that she cannot join any order yet, and Kaira replies 
"Rightly so". ``Persuasion check``

> Kaira is so mean.

## Mission recap

I am so happy that we survived this, it was very tough!

* 500ø
* +10 Order points
* 75 favour with Causa Cientiae

Lana needs to buy a bunch of stuff, including bandages, in the next session.

## Note on the rules

When you roll an **Adept** there are four different sect variants, so you
definitely know which sect the adept is part of, but I wanted to check if my
character also knew, so an *Occult knowledge* check seemed appropriate.

When you encounter a **Yōkai** you only have a general description of what
those entities are. However, there are hundreds if not thousands of different
types of yōkai, each one with different looks and features, they may look like
humans, animals, mythological creatures like dragons, but also like everyday
objects (not nowadays objects, but 17th century Japan's objects, like paper
umbrellas and tatamis) and many other things (human souls, fire). So, since
Lana encountered a yōkai near an stairway and I could imagine a stairway with
small columns on the side a yōkai of that would be great, and know what? There
is a yōkai that [looks like a
column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakabashira).

I might be considering writing a small table with some different yōkai that you
could encounter at each different site to have more variety.
