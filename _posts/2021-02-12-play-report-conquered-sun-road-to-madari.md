## Intro

I'm starting a new campaign with Disciples of Bone & Shadow, I got the
fantastic, super cool, sexy, hardcover limited edition of **[Disciples of Bone &
Shadow: Conquered Sun
Edition](https://blackoathgames.com/disciples-of-bone-shadow-1)** right at the
end of last year. I've been playing Seekers Beyond The Shroud quite a lot
lately (I have like 40+ of in-game days to write about), and also a bit of
Forbidden Lands and Ultraviolet Grasslands, but I should get back to Disciples,
it has the sexiest book. I'm thrilled about this new acquisition, as you can
see.

## Character generation

I will be using the *Lifepath Character Generator* from **[Marrow &
Splinters](https://blackoathgames.com/marrow-splinters)**,
the official zine of Disciples of Bone and Shadow. I generated a couple of
characters when I got the zine to test how things turned out with it, and to be
able to compare it with the character generation options introduced with the
Narrative Playbook, and I prefer the way that the zine does it, a bit a la
Forbidden Lands. This is one of those characters, and the one that I'm
selecting for this campaign:

- Home region: Deathrot Marsh
- Parent's Occupation: soldiers
- Archetype: Hunter
- Formative events: worked at a fishing boat at the Sea of Glass
- Significative events: never promoted to the position that was rightfully mine
- Stats: STR 14, DEX 17 (16), CON 12, WIL 12, INT 14, CHA 12.
- Name: she-Thythe (I'm pronouncing it as *tai-té*)

I've got the stats already given from the generator, I have an extra attribute
point from the *Significative events* that said that my character was *Bad
Tempered II*, that I will put it into DEX, and I have 2EPs to spend, I get
*Disarm Traps* and convert the remaining EP to 10 skill points for *Herb
lore*. Then I'm going to redistribute 10 skill points to Parry, since my
character uses a sword, and that gives me +10 parry, so, I will be avoiding
attacks using parry instead of dodge.

So, apart from the basic skills my character has: *Concussive Shot* and *Disarm
Traps*, she also has *Markmanship* as a passive skill; she is equipped with a
long bow, a one handed sword, a healing tincture, a lantern, lamp oil x1,
provisions x10 and bandages x10.

## Play report

<p align="center"><img

Thythe was born in a poor settlement near Deathroot Marsh; hunger came and she
moved with her parents to Madari, where they served as soldiers and
mercenaries. When she was older she wanted to make a fortune by herself, so she
moved to Akkar Strand. There, she tried to make ends met as a hunter and later
on as a guard in a fishing boat. She left the fishermen years later, as she
thought that the captain wasn't paying as much as she deserved, she was the one
who protected them all from the sea monsters after all.

> We start in a random hex.

**· HEX I23, Akkard Strand.** Thythe is done with Akkar Strand. Life is
difficult in here. She won't go back to providing security for fishermen, so
she will go back to Madari. She doesn't want to admit it, but her old parents
took the right decision when they moved from Deathrot Marsh and settled in
Madari many decades ago. She heads north-west.

``10 milestones to Everscar Highlands``

> And then another 10 milestones to Madari.


**· HEX H22, A.S.** Thythe comes across a pool of liquid metal. She doesn't have
anything on her to carry at least a little of this treasure, she must come back
in the future to take it all with herself. She spends some time looking for any
useful herbs, but the terrain looks completely desolated. She eats her rations
silently.

``Orientation fail, no surprise`` ``Twist: 0 -> 0`` ``+2XP hex``

> The *Twist* counter that we are tracking is a modifier to the surprise
> roll. If we are in control of the situation of whatever happened during the
> day we update it with a +1, whereas if we are not in control it is a -1.
> If nothing relevant happens regarding the "control of a situation" I don't
> update the Twist counter.

**· HEX G21, A.S.** Thythe slowly continues her journey to the Everscar
Highlands, but a flash flood surprises her. She grabs a tree with as much force
as she can and hopes that it won't collapse. When the water seems to have
slowed down she checks her belongings, the oil that she was carrying for the
lamp is now lost, the flasks are in pieces.

She is feeling a bit disoriented, the landscape has changed, and she doesn't
hear the sound of hundreds of goats marching.  There is a woman with her dog
looking at Thythe. Thythe raises her soaked hands, she doesn't want to appear
threatening, although since she is covered in mud she doubts that she will. She
asks for directions to the goatherd. She tells
her a little bit about this region of the Akkard Strand, Thythe thanks her and
keeps going. Once that she has put some distance between her and the goat-lady
she eats her daily ration while she looks for any herb that may prove useful.

``Orientation OK, no surprise`` ``Twist: 0 -> -1`` ``Milestones: 1`` ``Travel
complication`` ``CHA test OK``  ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX F20, A.S.** She can see a small group of **Madari rats** in the
distance, she readies her long bow, she will try to eliminate them before they
get any closer. ``x3 Madari Rats, HP: 2``

> Thythe has a DEX of 17 so she gets 2 shots before the enemies get into melee
> range if she wins the initiative in this round, otherwise she only gets one.

Thythe kills two enemies with two precisely shot arrows and  the remaining one
is sliced with her sword. She nods, recognising her own skills.

She eats a ration while she searches for herbs, and this time she finds
something interesting, 6 doses of *Dwarf Yellowcrest*.

> Once that we have a couple of different types of herbs we can use the
> *Alchemy* skill to brew different potions. My character has a 0 on *Alchemy*,
> but it is still worth it to collect herbs since you can sell them.

``Orientation OK, no surprise`` ``Twist: -1 -> 0`` ``Milestones: 2``
``+5XP vermin`` ``+2XP hex`` 

**· HEX E19, A.S.**  Thythe sees a settlement in the distance, she decides that
she will go there and resupply on rations, maybe a bit of lamp oil, and earning
some jats wouldn't hurt either.

The small settlement is bustling with activity, she hasn't seen so many people
in the same place in a long time. A sudden change happens as the earth starts
trembling and water bursts from everywhere. Another flood. Thythe doesn't see
any trees around, so she runs out of the settlement, uphill. ``DEX check OK``

> DEX check because I think that it fits.

She manages to avoid the worst part of it, but the townsfolk haven't been that
lucky. People are missing, and the atmosphere that she encountered before, full
of life and activity, is now gone, everyone is dead serious. There are some
people that have started to organise themselves already to form search
groups. Thythe heads to one of these groups, who knows, they might have a job
for her.

She greets the strangers, *'Peace in these unfortunate times, I'm a mercenary
hunter, I'm offering my services for the right price,'* she says ``Are they
friendly? Yes, but..`` ``Something that we think is the other way``
``Swear, time, obstacle, surrender``

The townspeople tell her that this hasn't been a natural disaster, they had
been given an ultimatum, they had to abandon this settlement by mid-day or
their enemies would destroy a floodgate that they relied on. Since they haven't
abandoned the settlement, their enemies' threats have actually come
true. Thythe asks who are these enemies ``Are they an individual? Very likely``
They are a single person, but a powerful one. Thythe tells them that she might
be able to get rid of the problem for them if they tell her more about this
individual. ``Do they want her to do that? Almost impossible`` They don't want
her to get rid of this individual. ``Maybe capture them? Unlikey``Capture is a
no-go again. ``What if she had help? Unlikely, and...`` ``Something that we
thinks is the other way`` ``Dominate, danger`` Due to the multiple
refusals that the townsfolk are giving her, she is starting to think that these
townspeople are dominated by fear and the dangers that they would to face if
they dared to oppose this individual. Thythe then tells them that she is an
outsider, and thereby this individual wouldn't need to know about her, if she
fails, she would be dead anyway. ``Do they want to hire her? Almost certain``

> It might seem that I've forced this outcome a little bit, but I found it
> difficult to believe that they didn't want any help after seeing their homes
> destroyed. Also, they're a pile of scumbags xd This has turned out to be very
> funny.

This seems to convince them. They tell her that her target is and old bounty
hunter that lives 10 hexes away to the east of this position.

> I generate this using the rules to create a mission.

Thythe decides to stock up on rations before heading east, she finds a small
tent already set up by a wandering merchant that still has their goods
intact. She also buys lamp oil, just in case. ``+13 rations, +1 lamp oil``

``Orientation fail, no surprise`` ``Twist: 0 -> 1`` ``Name: Clear Wood``
``Event: Disappearing Townsfolk`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX F19, A.S.** Thythe hears the horrible sounds of a **Spawn of Vhol'Est**
in the near distance, and then she readies her long bow. She uses her 
Markmanship skill to aim at it, and the abomination comes closer. Her arrow
misses the enemy and she draws her sword. She decides to fight it, she is angry
about missing her shot (*Bad Tempered II* trait in action). The first few
rounds seem to be good for her, she parries the abominations' attacks, lands a
few hits, but the Vhol'Est does too, and it attacks much quicker than she does.

> I realised too late that my character had 9/35 HP before I decided that it

She decides to fight until her last breath! She parries the attacks but she
doesn't hit the abomination, then she critically parries one of its attacks and
deals the death blow in the next turn.

> No injuries rules necessary, I managed to kill the abomination! BUT, I won't
> attempt something like this again unless I deal some ranged damage first.

She finds a *One handed Shalvan Wood Weapon* (worth 1500 jats) near the
corpse. She examines the weapon as she applies bandages to her wounds, she is
heavily injured, she thinks as she eats a ration, she will need to camp and
rest for a few days before continuing with her mission. ``First aid OK, +6HP``

``No surprise`` ``Twist: -1 -> -2`` ``+100XP elite enemy`` ``+2XP hex``

> Yep, I made a mistake and the Twist counter should have been updated to 0.

**· HEX F18, A.S.** Having rested for the day, her mind feels clearer, she
realises that the **Spawn of Vhol'Est** that she defeated yesterday was
guarding a hidden cave. Why was it guarding the cave? And, why did it suddenly
attack her? Was it trying to distract her? Thythe is worried that something
else might be happening in this cave, which is very close to a settlement, so
she makes a mental note to investigate it later.

> This could be a very cool side-mission.

She eats a ration and tries to rest, she also finds some herbs. ``Herb: Vesselbush
x2``  ``Surprise: location/hidden`` ``Twist: -2 -> -1``
``Action: distract`` ``Theme: problem`` ``+5HP`` 

**· HEX F18, A.S.** Thythe feels better than she did yesterday, but she doesn't
want to hurry her recovery yet. She patiently eats her rations and rests.

``No surprise`` ``Twist: -1 -> -1`` ``+5HP``

**· HEX F18, A.S.** Thythe is getting better, she should be ready to continue
with her mission tomorrow. She spends some time looking for more herbs, and
eats more rations. ``Herb: Vophis x 5`` ``No surprise`` ``Twist: -1 -> -1`` ``+5HP``

**· HEX G19, A.S.** Thythe encounters another goatherd, they talk a bit, and
Thythe warns him of the possible nest of **Spawns of Vhol'Est** nearby. They
part ways. ``CHA test OK``

``No surprise`` ``Twist: -1 -> 0`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX H18, A.S.** As she is walking towards the east, Thythe encounters a
lonely **Centipede**, she is able to slay it with a precise arrow shot.

``No surprise`` ``Twist: 0 -> 1`` ``+5XP vermin`` ``+2XP hex``

**· HEX I19, A.S.** Thythe encounters a **Sabershadow** this time, it has an
eerie aura floating around it. Thythe uses her *Markmanship* skill, aims, and
shots the arrow, which critically hits the beast!

> This is so cool, double damage and a critical! And I won the initiative round
> with a 19! (The sabershadow has an initiative of 18)

 Thythe rejoices, but something weird is happening with the wound that she has
 inflicted to the beast, it is regenerating the tissue. The beast, now in melee
 range, attacks, Thythe parries, and after a couple of rounds in this dance the
 beast finally dies. Thythe is unable to collect the pelt of the beast, quite a
 shame, it would have been sold for a couple hundred jats.

``No surprise`` ``Twist: 1 -> 2`` ``+10 XP common foe`` ``+25 XP tainted
enemy``  ``+2XP HEX`` 

> And we level up! We have 2EP points to spend.

## Recap

encounters, then she levels up.
