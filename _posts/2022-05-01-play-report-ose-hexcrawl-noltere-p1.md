## Intro

I'm running a solo hex-crawl using **Old-School Essentials**, the setting is
based on the first ever solo game that I ran, a **Labyrinth Lord** hex-crawl
campaign, that I was looking forward to moving to OSE.

At the end, I decided to maintain the map that I have already created in my
previous adventures in order to have some villages, cities and points of
interest already created, but I was going to play with a completely different
character and a different campaign goal (aka no campaign goal). The goal is to
run a very lightweight hex-crawl, without any high-level mission objectives or
anything like that. I wanted to start small. 

I'm using the *Carcass Crawler Inaugural Issue*, the official OSE zine, that
has a special class, the **Warden**, which I look at it as a mixture of ranger
and druid without magic. 

My PC is named **Ered**, she is a human and has the following ability scores:
STR 13, INT 12, WIS 12, DEX 14, CON 13, CHA 10. She is equipped with a hand axe
and a shield, leather armour and also carries a long bow.

The wardens are a secret society that protect their lands, and Ered is a novice
in this organisation, so she will get missions from them.

About the setting, we are playing on the **Noltere** region of the continent,
which is mostly ruled by humans. I'm starting on a random hex, which hasn't
been explored before in my previous **Labyrinth Lord** campaign. I won't be
sharing the full map, since I will be digitalising it as these play reports
progress.

## Play report

<p align="center"><img

- C27: *Tars-ôl*, village.
- D26: ruins of an old wizard's tower, damaged from an explosion.

### Day 1 

> On C27: **Tars-ôl** village

Ered arrived early in the morning to **Tars-ôl**, a small village of the
mostly-human controlled **Noltere** region, which had asked for assistance to
her elder wardens and they had sent here. The quest is simple, some kind of
wild beast is attacking their cattle and with the winter closing by, they need
the problem addressed. Ered has been tasked with tracking this wild beast to
its lair and uncovering their nature. After this the villagers will think what
to do next.

Ered goes where the last attack has happened in order to find tracks that she
can follow.

`Are the tracks on soft ground? Yes`, `Have 24h passed? Yes, but... soft
ground makes marks still clear` [tracking, 40% success rate: roll failed]

Ered cannot find a clear path following the tracks, so she goes west by
instinct. 

> On C25
>
> [No encounter, hills]

`Are there tracks? yes, soft, no 24h, hidden` [tracking, 20% success rate: roll OK]

Ered finally finds some tracks that she can follow `Do they end nearby? No` The
tracks seem to go East [d8 compass die] `Do they go back to the village? No`
`Any other direction? Yes, south-east`, but after spending some more time
looking at the tracks she realises that there are two different sets, one
headed back to **Tars-ôl** and the other one headed south-east.

She decides to go south-east.

> On D26
>
> [No encounter, hills]

She continues following the tracks, `Soft ground? No, but.. failure`, her hand
axe falls to the ground, bumps with some rocks and makes a lot of noise, birds
fly away from nearby trees and she mentally curses her clumsiness. `Do any
beasts come? No` [tracking, 22% success rate: roll OK] `Do the tracks end in
this hex? Yes` Ered finally sees where the tracks head to.

`More info, d30 companion, trigger: trap` There are some odd tracks nearby `Is
there something on those? No`, but they haven't caught anything and they
haven't been manipulated either. But the tracks definitely end here. She is
sure of it.

The day is nearing its end after a lot of tracking hard work, so Ered decides
to camp and rest until tomorrow, she could maybe see the wild beast during the
night. [-1 ration, no encounters during the night]

### Day 2

> Still on D26
>
> [Encounter]

Since the tracks end here and nothing has happened during the night Ered
decides to spend some time investigating this location. `Is the lair nearby
(very likely)? Yes`. After some time investigating Ered finally sees the nest,
at the same time she is surprised by a weird looking creature with eyes in
their tentacles [Encounter: **Otyugh**, reaction roll: 12 friendly]. It looks
at her very attentively and Ered tries to avoid making any sound or aggressive
movement, the creature continues to look at her and she can feel how it tries
to convey some sort of meaning to her [monster on the lair, reaction roll: 4
unfriendly]. Then the **Otyugh** goes away making the weirdest sound Ered has
ever heard.

Ered tries to go over to the side, just above some low rocks, to where the
**Otyugh** has come from, and she sees `W&W generator, hill: ruins of wizard
tower` the ruins of an old tower. There are rocks scattered everywhere, which
suggest an explosion, and the tower is now just one storey tall. [Dungeon
encounter, level 1: **[Killer
Bees](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Killer_Bee)** (1d10)
x10, mutated, they have legs]

> Of course, I wasn't expecting to roll Killer Bees at all, since it wouldn't
> made sense since my PC had been tracking *tracks* which obviously involve
> some kind of creature with paws, but it kind of made sense if they had their

> different.


There are mutated **Killer Bees** flying and *walking* around the nest, some
have long legs that look flamingo-like, whereas others have wolf-like
fangs and looked more dangerous. These mutated monsters explain the tracks and
the attacks that the villagers have had, Ered thinks, so she decides to convey
this discovery to the villagers and see what they decide to do next.

> On C27: **Tars-ôl** village

Ered arrives to the village and tells the village chief her discovery and which
type of creature was the one that has been eating their cattle. The village
chief and the other villagers tell her that they knew of the ruins of the
tower, they were from a wizard's tower that lived there decades ago and did
business with the village, but after a failed experiment the wizard went
away. Some old magic must have reacted with the local wildlife, Ered thinks.

`Do the villagers want to get rid of the mutant-Killer Bees (likely)? Yes` Ered
negotiates 10gp for tracking the lair of the monsters and she will receive 10gp
more once they have been slayed, but the villagers will be in charge of hiring
at least 3 adventurers that will join Ered in the subjugation, plus the
property of anything valuable inside the wizard's tower is given to Ered and
the adventurers.

Ered accompanies the village chief to the tavern to see if there are any
adventurers available for this mission [[OSE Adventuring Party

Ered explains the details of the mission to the five adventurers that will join
her and they agree to go to the ruins tomorrow morning.

Ered spends the night in a local inn to get ready for tomorrow [-4sp].

### Day 3

> Still on C27: **Tars-ôl** village

The adventurers and Ered gather in the center of the village and Ered leads
them to the ruins of the wizard's tower, the lair of the mutant **Killer
Bees**.

> On D26
>
> [No encounter]

They arrive without any incidents and they see the mutant **Killer Bees** x10
in the distance, one of them seems to be the Queen and it is accompanied by a
Guard.

> I made some mistakes during the combat, the **Killer Bees** are supposed to
> die when they sting someone (unless they're the Queen), but I forgot about
> that. I also decided that there was going to be a single Guard.

The encounter starts, the **Bees** aren't surprised, the Dwarf (A), a Fighter
(D) and Ered ready their missile weapons while the rest of the adventurers
hurry to melee range, all the missile weapons fail on this first round, but the
melee Fighter (B) manages to kill a Bee and the Cleric (E) does the same.

The Bee Queen and the Guard stand back and the rest of the Killer Bees start to
attack the adventurers on melee range, all the attacks fail.

On the second round the **Killer Bees** go first and some of their attacks
fail, but a Bee stings the meele Fighter (B), poisons her, and she falls [save
VS poison unsuccessful], the same happens to the Cleric (E) and the Magic User
(C), which are both also unable to resist the poison.

The adventurers' spirit is miraculously still strong and the Dwarf (A) and Ered
both kill a Bee each.

On the third round the adventurers go first, and Ered kills another Bee,
however the Bees also sting her, but she is able to resist the poison [save VS
poison OK].

On the following round Ered falls back and tries to remove the stinger while
the Dwarf (A) and the Fighter (D) continue the now very bloody combat against
the mutated bees.

On the last couple of rounds the two remaining adventurers and Ered manage to
kill the remaining Bees, but their victory is not celebrated since they have
lost three companions.

[+28XP each]
