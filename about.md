I'm [@mazmorreo](https://twitter.com/mazmorreo) (same nick on many Discord
servers). I'll write about my solo RPG sessions, house rules and post the
custom tables that I make for my games in this site. Also, expect a lot of
random thoughts.

My favourite part of playing is world-building, and I often choose what I'm
going to play depending on the world that the book is offering. I'm in constant
search for the perfect setting, right now that would be a mixture of: Dai Dark,
The Expanse, Biomega, Caves of Qud, Blame! and Dorohedoro. Then add lots of
yokai.



I have another blog in Spanish were I review solo/solo-able board games and
RPGs at [https://mazmorreoensolitario.com](https://mazmorreoensolitario.com)
