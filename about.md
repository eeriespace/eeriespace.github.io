I'm [@mazmorreo](https://twitter.com/mazmorreo) (same nick on many Discord
servers). I'll write about my solo RPG sessions, house rules and post the
custom tables that I make for my games in this site. Also, expect a lot of
random thoughts.

My favourite part of playing is world-building, and I often choose what I'm
going to play depending on the world that the book is offering. I'm in constant
search for the perfect setting, right now that would be a mixture of: Dai Dark,
The Expanse, Biomega, Blame! and Dorohedoro. Then add lots of yokai.

Solo RPG campaigns that I'm running: 

* Lana Vanne's ascension to the occult with [Seekers Beyond the Shroud](https://blackoathgames.com/seekers-beyond-the-shroud).
* Unnamed campaign with [Mothership](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/mothership).
* Unnamed hexcrawl campaign with [Labyrinth
  Lord](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/78524/Advanced-Edition-Companion-Labyrinth-Lord-noart-version)
  (which is in the process of being switched to [Old School
  Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials)).

Solo RPGs that I would like to run:

* SO MANY!

I have another blog in Spanish were I review solo/solo-able board games and
RPGs at [https://mazmorreoensolitario.com](https://mazmorreoensolitario.com)
