This is a collection of house rules that I use for the different RPGs that I'm
playing:


## Seekers Beyond The Shroud

1. **Always play with the *[Making Combat Less
   Deadly](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d9b9e602f7a5637cf2b6c41/t/5e5bc31f0054c85361878a14/1583072038184/Making+combat+less+deadly.pdf)*
   official rules** from Blackoath Entertainment.
2. **When you roll a new character get as many *Bandages* in your equipment as
   many previously deceased characters you have.**
   So, if you died 5 times you get Bandages x5 for your sixth character's
   starting equipment (plus anything that they get from their background).
3. **Use my [Yōkai
   Bestiary]({{site.baseurl}}/03/22/the-yokai-bestiary-for-seekers-beyond-the-shroud/)**
   to extend and substitute the official yōkai foe.
4. **When there is a initiative tie in combat, the side with higher DEX wins.**
   If there is another tie, the side with highest HP wins. If there is again
   another tie, re-roll your initiative.
5. **When the enemies have ranged and melee weapons, favour ranged weapons in
   hallways and melee weapons everywhere else.**
